# The gate a push has to get through: build, ctest, and the three Godot suites.
#
# It exists because two of those ctest cases — node_demos_match_the_registry and
# game_sounds_match_the_corpus — went red and stayed red across several commits without
# anybody noticing. They are the checks that catch a *generated* file edited by hand
# instead of the generator that writes it, which is a mistake that looks fixed until
# something regenerates. A check nothing runs is a comment.
#
# Deliberately the whole suite rather than the two cheap cases. Picking the checks that
# would have caught last time's mistake is how a suite becomes a monument to old bugs;
# the run is about a minute and a half, which is cheaper than a bad push.
#
# Machine-specific paths are read from git config so this file stays the same everywhere:
#
#   git config soundgraph.godot "/path/to/godot_console"   # optional; suites skip without
#   git config soundgraph.build "build"                    # optional; defaults to build/
#
# Escape hatch: git push --no-verify. Use it for a push that cannot break anything —
# a docs branch, a WIP spike — and not to get past a red suite.

# last words with it: twice, a push was refused for a suite that had in fact passed.

# verdicts - so this is not a fix for a mechanism anybody has watched happen. It removes
# the dependence on one, which is cheaper than continuing to guess, and it leaves the
# whole log on disk so the next unexplained refusal can be read rather than re-run.
