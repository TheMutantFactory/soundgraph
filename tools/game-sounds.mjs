// Rebuilds examples/banks/demo/ — the Axoloti demo set's own game sounds — from the sfxr
// corpus.
//
// These five files are generated, but until now the recipe lived only in the shell
// history of whoever made them. That is the same trap as a hand-copied source list: two
// things that have to agree, and no way to notice when they stop. Changing the mapper
// meant the corpus was regenerated and these were not, so a jump on the board and a
// jump in the test rig were quietly different sounds.
//
// They live beside examples/banks/demo.json rather than on the examples shelf, because
// the bank is what they are for: every one compiled for the board and was written to a
// card, and the shelf has the same sounds as the sfxr shelf's presets — with knobs, and
// with the pulse-width path the board does not take. The editor's Sandbox plays the
// shelf; the board plays these.
//
// The mapping below is the record. Each game sound is a corpus case picked for how it
// sounds, so this file is the only place a taste decision is stored — which is why it is
// a table and not a search.
//
