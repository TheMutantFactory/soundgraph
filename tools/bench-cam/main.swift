// bench-cam — a camera you can call from a script.

// It exists because macOS will not let a command-line tool have a camera. TCC grants
// access to *bundles*, by identifier, after the bundle asks; a bare executable invoked
// from a shell has no identity to grant, so `imagesnap` and friends are refused before
// the request ever reaches the permission list. This is the same program wearing a
// bundle, an Info.plist and an ad-hoc signature, which is all TCC actually wanted.
//
// The point of it is a closed loop: an agent that changes a screen and can then look at
// the screen, rather than describing the change and asking a human what happened.

//   bench-cam shot.jpg --preview        # a window with a shutter, for setting up the shot
//
// There is deliberately no --exposure or --iso. macOS does not offer them: manual
// exposure duration and ISO are iOS-only on AVCaptureDevice, and a UVC webcam here can
// only be told to hold whatever exposure it has already chosen. Which makes the clipping
// meter in the preview the whole game — the fix for a blown-out photograph of a screen is
// to change the light in the room, and the meter is what says when that has worked.
