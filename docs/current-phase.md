# Current Phase

**Features until the show.** Work happens on short-lived branches off `main`, each
landing with its tests and a tag named for itself. `dev` was the integration branch until
the `spoken-roll` tag (2026-08-23) and has not moved since; `main` is 52 commits ahead of
it, and everything now goes there directly. Knobcon is Sep 11; the
Sep 4 feature freeze was deliberately relaxed ("it's a great marketing tool and we don't
need hardware to make it spread itself"), so features keep landing: since the freeze
decision the vocabulary grew from 25 to 44 node types (through the maths family, Clock,
ScaleQuantizer, StepSequencer, Euclid, Comb/Allpass, Compressor, Sampler, Formant and
the TMS5220 Speech node), the editor's top row, roll, rack, shelves and feedback dialog
were reworked, and every one of the 280 examples is load-verified.

Milestones A, B, C and F are all complete. Each feature lands with its tests, rides the
full gate (`tools/pre-push.sh`, enforced on every push including tags), and gets a tag
named for itself — the tag list is the changelog.

## Where the project stands

One graph model runs, within declared tolerances, under four compilers on four
architectures:

| target | how it runs | verified by |
|---|---|---|
| Windows x64 | `sg-play`, `sg-render`, `sg-validate` | 25 ctest cases (34 with the plugin SDKs), 18 golden vectors |
| Browser | WebAssembly in an AudioWorklet | `verify-goldens.mjs`, 18 cases, worst 2.09e-7 |
| Godot 4.7 | GDExtension | ~1170 editor checks, plus design and layout suites |
| ESP32-S3 | generic firmware, Waveshare audio board | `sg-serial.py verify-goldens`, all 18 cases, worst 9.16e-5 |

`dsp-core` still depends on nothing but the C++ standard library, and no editor or host
holds a second copy of the node vocabulary, the search ranking or the validator.

Toolchains live outside the repository: ESP-IDF v5.5 at `C:\Users\danie\esp-idf`,
Emscripten at `C:\Users\danie\emsdk`, Godot 4.7.1 under `C:\Users\danie\Downloads\gofo\`,
and a repo-local `.venv` with pyserial and esptool.

**What is actually on the Windows box as of 2026-08-25**, because the paragraph above
described the machine it was written on and this clone found none of it. Reinstalled this
session: Emscripten **4.0.20** at `C:\Users\danie\emsdk` — that version and not `latest`,
because the Godot extension must be built against the same Emscripten as the 4.7.1 export
template and `docs/decisions.md` records what a mismatch costs — plus CMake 4.4.2 and Ninja
1.13.2 from winget, both user-scope, no elevation.

Still missing, so **the native build, ctest and therefore `tools/pre-push.sh` cannot run
here**: there is no C++ compiler at all — no MSVC, no gcc, no clang — and no ESP-IDF.

**The toolchain is now complete.** Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 (MSVC 19.44) was
installed by hand — it needs UAC, and `winget` returns 1602 from a non-interactive shell.
It lives at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools`, **not** the
Community path this file used to name and `tools/pre-push.sh` used to hard-code; the gate
now asks `vswhere` instead of assuming.

The whole gate passes here for the first time: **ctest 25/25**, editor 1174 checks, design
and layout suites, and `verify-roundtrip` with identical audio on all three patches.

**Smart App Control blocks freshly built binaries, at random.** It is on
(`HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CI\Policy`, `VerifiedAndReputablePolicyState = 1`)
and it blocked `build/bin/test_dx7_operator.exe` — a binary this machine had just compiled —
while the other 24 test executables, equally unsigned and equally fresh, ran. The verdict is
per file hash, so **relinking clears it**: touching the source and rebuilding produced a new
hash that ran, all 5 cases passing. ctest reports this as `BAD_COMMAND` rather than a
failure, and running the binary by hand is what says "blocked by your organization's Device
Guard policy"; `Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity/Operational` names the file. Expect it again
on any rebuild, and do not read it as a broken test.

Reputation, not signature: emsdk's own `clang.exe` is `NotSigned` and runs fine, which is
why the WebAssembly build never hit this. Turning Smart App Control off would also fix it
and is **one-way** — no supported route back to On short of reinstalling Windows.

The native `build/` directory on the Windows machine is **Ninja + MSVC**, so `cmake
--build build` only works from a shell that has the VS environment loaded — run it from a
"x64 Native Tools" prompt, or wrap it:

```bash
cmd /c '"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat" >nul && cmake --build build'
```

The trap is that it does not fail immediately: already-built targets keep running and
ctest stays green, so a plain shell looks fine right up until a pull adds a new source
file — then `cl.exe` can't find `<string>` and the errors point at the code instead of at
the environment. That is exactly how the macos-support merge first presented on Windows.

## Done in this phase

- **The full editor is exported to `/soundgraph/editor`, and the handoff works end to end.**
  Moving a knob on the lite page and pressing "Open in the full editor" carries the patch
  across: the Godot editor boots, reads `soundgraph.handoff.v1`, clears it, and opens that
  document instead of its default example. Confirmed from outside the canvas —
  `window.soundgraphEditor` reported `document: start-here.json, nodes: 7, from: handoff`.

  Three things that had never been established on this machine, now established:
  the web GDExtension builds (godot-cpp has **no 4.7 branch** — 4.7 support is on `master`,
  which ships `extension_api-4-7.json` describing 4.7.0 against a 4.7.1 engine, which is
  fine within a minor version); it **loads**, with no `function signature mismatch`, the
  browser reporting `Emscripten 4.0.20, single-threaded, GDExtension support`; and the
  export lands below the lite page so its service worker's scope is `/editor-web/editor/`
  and cannot reach the page above it. The template's own `godot.js` contains `4.0.20`,
  confirming the version pinned when Emscripten was reinstalled.

  **The PWA caching is unverified.** Service worker registration fails in the browser used
  for this session — for *any* script, on a plain `http.server` as well as `tools/serve.py`,
  in a secure context with the script serving 200 as `text/javascript`. That is the harness,
  not the export, but it means "cached from the second visit" and the offline behaviour have
  not been re-confirmed here. Check in an ordinary Chrome before relying on them.

  Two loose ends: the **desktop** extension was not rebuilt, so opening `editor-godot` in
  the Godot editor still reports a missing DLL (the web export is unaffected — it packs the
  web library). And `/soundgraph/desktop` has nothing to point at until there is a numbered
  release.

- **`/soundgraph` is the front door, and says what is behind it.** The page now leads with
  the pitch and the graph; the JSON source is collapsed below it. Three surfaces are
  declared in `editor-web/surfaces.js` — this page, the full editor, the desktop
  application — each announced with what it costs, and linked only once a URL is
  configured. The current patch travels to the full editor through localStorage, since both
  read the same file and ask the same core about it. Decision and the hosting constraint
  (the export's service worker must not be able to reach this page) in `docs/decisions.md`.

  It also turned up a bug that predates it: controls drive the engine, not the document, so
  **saving, downloading or handing off a patch carried the values it loaded with** and
  discarded every knob the visitor had moved — the golden moment among them. All three now
  go through the live control values, while leaving unapplied edits in the source pane
  alone.

- **The web editor has an introduction, and draws the graph.** `editor-web` now opens on a
  prepared patch (`examples/patches/start-here.json`) and a six-step tour: hear it, read it
  left to right, drag the filter cutoff, compare against the original, decide what to keep.
  Above the JSON pane there is a read-only picture of the patch — nodes at their authored
  positions, cables weighted and dashed by signal type from the registry — so "the filter"
  is something on screen rather than a word in a label. Persistent actions (New patch,
  factory patches, Save locally, Help, About, Join) sit in a bar under the header, and
  **Help → Restart introduction** runs the tour again. Signups and one funnel row per visit
  go to the feedback service. Three decisions in `docs/decisions.md` (2026-08-25).

  Walked end to end in a browser: the audio-failure recovery screen and its silent path, the
  four highlighted groups, the one-octave golden-moment threshold, the Original/Your version
  toggle, the bypass lesson rewiring the graph and putting it back exactly, the mailing
  panel's decline and error states, the skip path, and a returning visitor opening into
  their locally saved patch.

  **That walk asserted the DOM, not the rendering, and it missed a defect that reached a
  person.** `.tour-modal` sets `display: flex`, which outranks the UA stylesheet's
  `[hidden] { display: none }`, so `modal.hidden = true` set a property and hid nothing: the
  arrival overlay stayed painted over the coach mark that had replaced it, with its buttons
  still disabled from the click. The tour ran correctly underneath, which is what made it
  read as a hang. Every check passed because `element.hidden` reports the property you just
  set rather than whether anything is drawn. Assert `getComputedStyle(el).display`, and take
  a screenshot when one can be taken — this is the same lesson as the Godot inspector that
  was off the right-hand edge of the window while every measurement passed. The stylesheet
  invariant is now enforced in `verify-onboarding.mjs`.

  Four more defects came out of that walk and are fixed: the spoken signal order was breadth-first and announced the amplifier before the
  filter; the status line blamed the patch when the engine was what failed to load; a
  malformed address was headed "that did not connect" when nothing had been sent; and a
  coach mark pointed at a control below the fold without scrolling to it. A fifth — the 808
  kit rendering as a 330-pixel stamp with 3-pixel lettering — was an SVG with a viewBox and
  no width/height attributes, so `height: auto` had no ratio to keep.

- Device reliability: malformed-patch abuse suite, thirty-cycle power soak with **0 bytes**
  of heap drift, and a truncated upload no longer wedges the console. Both re-run against
  the firmware carrying all eighteen embedded golden patches — the earlier numbers were a
  different binary, so they were not evidence about this one.
- One-click deploy from the web editor over Web Serial (written, never clicked — see below).
- `NoteInput.trigger`, and every generated patch rewired to it, so a one-shot fires on every
  note instead of only on the first of an overlapping run. Four notes that used to make one
  burst now make four.
- Every generated sound is playable up the keyboard. `Slide` and `Arpeggio` gained the
  frequency parameter the oscillator always had, so the head of a patch's pitch chain holds
  its own pitch and the keyboard is connected to it as well: played standalone the note
  wins and the sound transposes, imported as a module the NoteInput is dropped and the
  parameter is what remains. The mapper offsets `transpose` so middle C is the pitch sfxr
  chose — 0.0045 cents off, and the port report is unchanged at 32 of 41.
- A jig for every node type, and a check that says so. `NodeHarness` records what it builds,
  and `test_nodes` compares that against the registry after the suite runs — so a new node
  cannot ship without one. It found `AudioInput`, which had never been driven because it is
  the only node whose input arrives through its *outputs*.
- A demo patch for every node type, in `examples/patches/nodes/`: the smallest playable
  patch where you can hear that node and hear what changes when you drag it. Each one also
  declares the change its own description tells you to try, and the suite renders the patch
  with and without it — because "does it make a sound" passes even when the node is
  bypassed, and a demo that doesn't demonstrate anything is decoration.
- The editor's examples menu is built by scanning rather than from a list, which is what
  made 33 entries practical.
- Two generated-file drift traps closed with scripts that both sync and `--check`, wired
  into the main suite: `tools/game-sounds.mjs` (the eight game sounds, whose recipe used to
  live only in a shell history) and `tools/mirror-examples.mjs` (`editor-godot/examples`).
- Godot editor: undo/redo, layered layout with crossing reduction and straightening,
  PCB-style cable routing with draggable waypoints, grid tiers that mean something,
  intent search with per-row Add buttons, Atkinson Hyperlegible throughout.

## Resolved: the demo surface is the Godot editor, in the browser

The 90-second script in `KNOBCon_2026.md` assumed a browser that patches visually, and the
`editor-web` page cannot do that — it is the "simple web reference editor" the roadmap
asked for, a JSON pane plus generated controls, so connecting a node there means typing
JSON in front of an audience. That looked like a fork: rebuild the web editor, or drop the
browser from the demo.

It was neither. The Godot editor now **exports to WebAssembly and runs as a static page**,
extension and all. Same program, same layout engine, same `dsp-core` — reached by a URL.
The script's "play the browser synth" and "connect LFO to filter modulation" are the same
nine steps that already work, and the QR code points at the real editor rather than a
lesser one.

```bash
godot --headless --path editor-godot --import
node tools/export-web.mjs            # stamps the build, then exports
python -m http.server 8178 --directory build-godot-web
```

`export-web.mjs` wraps the export rather than replacing a one-line command for its own
sake: it stamps first, and an export that skipped the stamp would ship a bundle carrying
whatever stamp happened to be on disk — a build claiming to be a different build, which
is worse than no stamp at all. It finds Godot from `SOUNDGRAPH_GODOT`, `--godot`, then the PATH under
each of the names it actually ships as — `godot` is not one of them on the Windows
box, where it is on the PATH as `Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe` — and
finally the folder `tests/CMakeLists.txt` already knows about. The stamp is what View's last menu item and the browser tab title read back, so a
reload that served a cached bundle says so instead of looking identical to a fresh one.

Two things that build depends on, both easy to get wrong and both documented in
`docs/decisions.md`: the extension must be compiled with hidden visibility, and against the
same Emscripten as the export template (4.0.20 for Godot 4.7.1). Either one wrong aborts
the engine with `function signature mismatch`, which names neither cause.

**Audio out of the exported editor is confirmed by ear**: playing the computer keyboard in
Chrome sounds the synth. That closes the last question about this surface — it is a demo,
not a visual demo.

Two things had to be true for it. Godot's `default_playback_type.web` is *Sample*, which
pre-bakes a stream into a buffer and cannot work for a generator, so every player now asks
for `PLAYBACK_TYPE_STREAM` explicitly. And Godot starts no audio driver at all — no
`AudioContext`, not even a request for its worklets — until the page has had a real user
gesture. Synthetic events do not lift that; only a person clicking does.

## Open

- **The Web Serial deploy button has never been clicked.** It is gesture-gated by design,
  so it needs a human. Everything around it is verified; the button itself is not.
- **The introduction has not been heard through a browser.** The wasm now builds here (see
  the toolchain note below), all 21 golden cases match the native vectors, and the tutorial
  patch has been rendered and measured through the same module — it builds, it pulses evenly
  (0.77 to 0.99 across the eight steps), it peaks at 0.715 with the limiter idle, and one
  octave of cutoff takes the 880 Hz band from 0.6 to 3.5. The editor page loads that module,
  types its cables from the real registry and builds its controls from the real validator.

  What is still missing is a person clicking Start and listening. The AudioContext path
  needs a trusted user gesture, which is exactly what a driven browser cannot supply, so
  everything downstream of `engine.start()` — worklet, context, the meter — is inferred from
  the module being correct rather than observed. Two minutes with headphones settles it, and
  `docs/decisions.md` records that Godot's audio needed the same and behaved differently
  than every automated check predicted.
- **Nothing has been stored in the feedback service, and that is the tested half.** A funnel
  row from `http://localhost:8177` reaches `feedback.mutantfactory.net` and comes back
  `202 {"discarded": true}` — the preflight passes, the response is readable, and the row is
  refused at the door because a dev origin marks its funnel rows `test`. So the transport,
  the CORS allow-list and the envelope are all confirmed against the live service.

  What has never happened is a report that is actually **kept**: no funnel row from a
  production origin, and no signup at all — a real address would be stored, so that one is
  not a thing to try idly. The origin that ends up serving this page still has to be added
  to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; until then it is refused with no CORS headers, which reads from the
  page as a network failure.
- The **sandbox's** sounds have not been heard in a browser. They use the same generator and
  the same `playback_type` as the editor's synth, which is confirmed audible, so this is a
  reasonable inference rather than a verified fact — pressing Space in the Sandbox tab would
  settle it in ten seconds.
- The exported editor is ~46 MB uncompressed, ~10 MB gzipped. It is a PWA, so that cost is
  paid once and later visits are offline — but the *first* load is still the one an audience
  watches, so whatever hosts it must serve compressed, over HTTPS (service workers need a
  secure context). Caching begins on the second visit; see `editor-godot/README.md`.
- The editor can now be **rendered to a PNG** and looked at:
  `godot --path editor-godot --script res://screenshot.gd -- shot.png 1400 900`. Not
  `--headless` — headless has no rendering server, so there is nothing to capture. Worth
  knowing why it exists: the design work had been running entirely on measurement, and the
  first time anybody rendered it, the inspector turned out to be off the right-hand edge of
  the window with its text cut in half. Every automated check had passed, because measuring
  a widget cannot tell you the widget is outside the window.
- **Resolved: the shutdown crash was a race with the audio thread.** It is worth keeping
  the whole story, because the debugging was worse than the bug.

  The round trip began failing about one run in five with 0xC0000005, *after* the work had
  succeeded. I assumed it was the flake documented earlier in this file, spent three fixes
  on the teardown path, and only then measured the commit before the design pass: 20 of 20
  clean. The regression was mine and I had spent an hour proving things about the wrong
  code.

  Two measurements found it. Under `--verbose` it never reproduced in 30 runs — a race
  announcing itself, since the only thing verbose changes is timing. And a clean run leaks
  an `AudioStreamGeneratorPlayback` with a reference count of exactly 1, which is
  AudioServer still holding it.

  AudioServer mixes on its own thread and keeps a reference to the generator playback the
  editor fills every frame. `_exit_tree` runs *inside* `free()`, so there were no frames
  between stopping the player and destroying the GDExtension engine — and if that thread
  was mid-mix, the process died. `shutdown_audio()` is now separate and public: stop the
  player, free it, drop the engine, then let two frames pass before anything is freed.
  36 consecutive clean runs, against a rate that was failing one in five.

  The design work did not cause it so much as expose it: more per-frame work across the
  extension boundary widened a window that had always been there.

  One real bug did come out of the wrong-headed search. The glow overlay reordered
  GraphEdit's children every frame, because GraphEdit keeps internal children of its own
  and puts them back on top, so the two fought sixty times a second. `z_index` does the
  same job without touching the tree.

- **The shutdown flake is fixed where it was ours, and named where it is not.** The gate
  failures ("editor_test did not report success") were the audio thread mid-mix in a
  player being freed during the suite's own teardown — before the verdict could print.
  Every teardown now stops players under `AudioServer.lock()`, and the game sounds shut
  down deliberately instead of trusting tree order; fifty instrumented runs since show
  zero verdictless exits. What remains is a crash *after* `quit()`, inside Godot 4.7's
  own audio cleanup — same fault offset every time, invisible to the gate because the
  verdict has always flushed by then, and out of script's reach. `quit_test.gd` is the
  instrument that isolated it: boot, load the sandbox voices, tear down, quit — about
  seven seconds a run, with Windows Error Reporting as the witness stdout cannot be.
  Two measurement traps paid for on the way: WER batches its reports (event times are
  reporting times, not crash times), and the console wrapper exe swallows the child's
  exit code — the inner binary tells the truth.
- The sandbox still leaks a variable number of `AudioStreamGeneratorPlayback` objects at
  exit (refcount exactly 1 — AudioServer's own hold), which is the residue of that same
  engine bug rather than a defect of the teardown.
- Safari and Firefox are untested. Only Chrome has run the browser build.
- macOS and Linux have never been compiled — CMake and miniaudio cover them, unexercised.
- `AudioInput` in the browser has no `getUserMedia`, so `delay-echo.json` loads and
  schedules correctly but has nothing to process.
- `AudioInput` nodes still produce silence on the ESP32 board. The ES7210 microphone
  array is driven now — `mic` on the console captures from it — but nothing routes those
  samples into a graph yet, so the node has a source and no wire to it.

## Next features, in order (agreed 2026-08-20)

The vocabulary audit against Max/Pure Data settled a shortlist, ranked by leverage.
Landed so far from it: the maths family (Clip, Abs, MinMax, Compare, SampleHold — with
Random deliberately rejected as two spellings of things the vocabulary already says),
the Clock node (bpm, note divisions with triplets and dots, MPC-style swing, a bar
downbeat output, and a run gate that rewinds — patches share a tempo by sharing a value,
not through a global transport), and the ScaleQuantizer (twelve scales, twelve roots,
speaking octaves like the fm wire; nearest-semitone-then-nearest-degree, ties resolving
down — its demo is Noise → SampleHold → Quantizer on the Clock's eighths, the generative
melody the shortlist promised), and the StepSequencer (one sixteen-step lane per node —
wire a second lane from the same Clock into any knob's modulation input and every step
locks it, which is the Elektron trick said in cables rather than bolted on; the Clock's
bar output on the reset input keeps odd-length lanes bar-locked polymeters instead of
accidents; kMaxParameters went 8 → 24 to make room for honest one-knob-per-step
parameters).

Also landed: Comb and Allpass primitives with Crush riding along, and the reverb as a
shipped module — `examples/patches/warehouse.json` defines a Schroeder reverb inline
(eight damped combs, four allpasses) with Size and Damp arriving as signals through bus
nodes, because an exported module input reaches one port. Feedback 0.84 over 30 ms
combs measures a 1.2 s t60, and the Size knob reaches 0.97 for six-plus seconds.

And the Compressor closed the list: feed-forward, with a sidechain input that the
detector listens to instead of the input when connected — its demo is a pad that never
meets the kick except through the sidechain, pumping. **The whole audited shortlist has
landed**: the vocabulary went from 25 node types to 40 in one pass, every one with a
jig, a machine-verified demo, and both Godot extensions rebuilt.

The Karplus-Strong experiment ran, and both halves answered. Graph feedback through
Delay works exactly as documented: the cycle validates, rings for seconds, and its
period is the delay plus one 64-sample block, measured within a sample of prediction.
But that route cannot track a keyboard (nothing computes 1/f), so the shipped
instrument uses the Comb instead — whose loop is already Karplus-Strong, sample-exact —
via a new `frequency` input that tunes the loop to one period of the incoming signal.
`examples/patches/plucked-string.json` is the whole 1983 paper as four nodes in a
module: noise burst into a tuned comb, in tune to a tenth of a hertz, with Sustain,
Damp, Pick and Echo knobs.

Euclid landed too: hits spread as evenly as they will go, a gate output for the hits
and a rest output for the offbeats, so a kick and its hats come from one node. On the
bench for a next pass: an editor oscilloscope (editor work, not DSP), and probability
gates. The sampler's stage one is landed — schema buffers, the Sampler node, the chunk-identity
exit test — per its plan:
docs/sampler-design.md — buffers inline like modules, one Sampler node whose slice
input makes it the slicer, generated breaks rather than recorded ones, four stages
with an exit test each, all post-freeze. Tempo-synced delay times and a stereo field
still wait their turn.

## Remaining before the show

Per `KNOBCon_2026.md`, none of it is code: landing page, README pass, QR, getting-started,
architecture diagram, board page, short video, and spare hardware.

## Traps worth knowing

These all cost real time once and are written up in `decisions.md` or the component
READMEs. Collected here because the pattern is the same each time — the symptom pointed
somewhere other than the cause.

- **The web page runs whatever `editor-web/soundgraph.wasm` is on disk.** It is
  gitignored build output, so a clone or a machine that has not run the WebAssembly build
  lately is serving a core from whenever it last did — and nothing says so. On 2026-08-25
  this machine's copy was from Aug 10, which predates `Clock` and `StepSequencer`, so the
  onboarding tour's own tutorial patch could not have loaded. `verify-onboarding.mjs` does
  not catch it: it checks the tour against the patch file, not against the compiled core.
  Rebuild before believing anything the browser shows.
- **An embedded Godot subwindow has no window behind it.** `Window.is_embedded()` is
  true by default, `DisplayServer.window_get_native_handle` then returns the *main*
  window's, and a plugin handed it draws over the whole editor. Turning
  `gui_embed_subwindows` off is the fix, and putting it back has to wait for
  `tree_exited` — `queue_free()` is deferred, and Godot refuses the change while the
  child window is still shown, with a warning rather than an error.
- **The same plugin reports different sizes to different hosts.** Surge XT asks
  `sg-host` for 1141x711 and the Godot extension for 2282x1422 on one screen. Neither is
  wrong: Godot's process is per-monitor DPI aware and sg-host's is not, so the plugin is
  answering a different question about the same display. Never hard-code either.
- **2026-09-01, the exit crash again: the leak is fixed, the crash is not, and the gate
  now says so.** Chased because the push gate had started printing a bare
  `Segmentation fault` line from bash roughly one suite in ten, always after that suite
  had printed its verdict, and passing anyway.

  What was actually wrong and is now fixed: **thirty-eight of forty-one headless harnesses
  never called `shutdown_audio()` at all.** They instantiated `main.tscn`, did their work
  and called `quit()` straight into the race. Only `roundtrip.gd`, `editor_test.gd` and
  `quit_test.gd` had the teardown, each written out by hand. There is now one
  `harness_exit.gd` and every harness leaves through it.

  **A correction, made the same day.** The first write-up of this said the
  `AudioStreamGeneratorPlayback` leak was *gone*, on the strength of twenty-four
  consecutive runs with no "instance was leaked at exit" line. Every one of those runs was
  `editor_test`. Asked more widely, the leak is still there: `legalize_test` and
  `tidy_test` report it, `crossing_semantics`, `routes_test` and `editor_test` do not. So
  it is no longer universal, where before it was every run — the same shape as the crash,
  reduced and not cured. Twenty runs of one suite is not a claim about the suite next to
  it, which is a lesson this repository keeps buying.

  That weakens but does not remove the decoupling argument: `editor_test` shows no leak in
  eight runs and still crashes in three or four of them, so for that suite the crash is
  not the leak.

  What is not fixed is the crash, and the useful new fact is **where it is not**. With
  `HARNESS_EXIT_TRACE=1` the teardown prints each step, and the runs that segfault still
  print `[exit] quit returned`. Every GDScript statement completes, including `quit()`.
  Whatever remains is in Godot 4.7's own shutdown after the tree is done, exactly as this
  file already suspected — now measured rather than inferred.

  Rates, on this machine: `editor_test` 4 of 8 and 3 of 8 — far above the "few percent"
  recorded above, and it is the largest suite by a wide margin. `legalize_test` 1 of 11.
  `crossing_semantics` caught once. It is not one suite's defect; it scales with how much
  the suite does.

  Two hypotheses tested and **rejected**, so nobody spends the afternoon again:
  `queue_free()` → `remove_child()` + `free()` in `editor_test`'s teardown changed nothing
  (4 of 8 before, 3 of 8 after), and releasing `scope_probe`'s second reference to the
  engine inside `shutdown_audio()` changed nothing either. That second one is kept anyway:
  a probe holding a reference to a shut-down engine is wrong regardless of this crash.

  The gate now reads the exit status instead of discarding it, and the tolerated case is
  drawn as narrowly as the evidence allows. `harness_exit.gd` prints
  `HARNESS_SCRIPT_COMPLETE` after `quit()` returns, so there are two markers rather than
  one, and a verdict on its own no longer excuses a dead process:

  ```
  no verdict                                    refused
  verdict, no marker, and a bad status          refused — it died inside the suite
  both markers, exit 0                          passed
  both markers, then signal 139                 unstable pass, named and counted
  anything else non-zero                        refused
  ```

  The last two lines are the point. What is excused is exactly *every assertion passed and
  every scripted teardown statement completed, and then Godot fell over in its own
  shutdown* — not "the log contains a happy string". And only signal 139, the one actually
  observed: a SIGABRT, a timeout or an out-of-memory kill has not earned the exemption
  just by arriving late, and letting it inherit one is how the next real defect would get
  waved through.

  Every run ends with

  ```
  PASS: 7
  POST-VERDICT TEARDOWN CRASH: 2 — editor_test routes_test
  FAIL: 0
  ```

  so a sudden change in the crash rate is visible without blocking unrelated work.

- **The 0xC0000005 exit crash is rarer, not gone.** shutdown_audio() plus two frames took
  it from ~1 in 5 to the point where 36 consecutive clean runs looked like zero — and on
  2026-08-09 it fired twice in 11 runs, then 0 in the next 32. A residual few-percent
  flake passes any streak you are patient enough to collect. It still crashes *after* the
  work succeeds; verify-roundtrip labels it CRASHED rather than a refusal. If it climbs
  back toward 1-in-5, suspect the teardown path first and measure against an older
  commit before theorising.
- **Counting redraws does not test a redraw.** The rack's cable dimming needed
  `Rack.select()` to redraw the cable layer, which is a sibling of the modules rather than
  one of them. The test counted `_draw()` calls before and after — and passed with the fix
  taken back out, because something else in the test environment was already redrawing that
  layer every frame. The screenshot was the only thing that had told the truth. What made
  the test real was moving the decision out of `_draw()` into `Rack.cable_related()` and
  asking *that*: which cables are lit, given a selection. A test of a side effect is at the
  mercy of everything else that causes the same side effect; a test of a decision is not.
- A **GDScript type-inference error** leaves a half-built editor, and the headless test
  then awaits a coroutine that never resolves. It *hangs* instead of printing the parse
  error. `editor_test.gd` now bails out early; if a run ever hangs again, look for a parse
  error first.
- **`editor-godot/examples/` is build output** mirrored from `examples/patches/`. It has now
  gone stale twice, by two different routes: first as a POST_BUILD step that only ran when
  the extension relinked, then as an always-run target in the *Godot* build directory —
  which nobody runs when only a patch has changed. `tools/mirror-examples.mjs` does the sync
  now, and `godot_examples_are_mirrored` in the main suite is what notices. The lesson is
  narrower than "mirror carefully": **a guard that lives in one build only guards that
  build.**
- **A gate is not a trigger.** A one-shot patch gated by `NoteInput.gate` fired once and
  then went quiet under rolling key presses, because overlapping notes never let the gate
  fall and an AHD envelope has no edge to find. Worse in the sandbox, where `all_notes_off()`
  followed by `note_on()` in the same frame produced *no* low sample at all — control events
  drain at block boundaries — so it worked or didn't depending on where the block edge fell.
  `NoteInput.trigger` pulses on every note; percussion takes the trigger, anything that
  sustains takes the gate.
- **A patch's pitch cannot live only in a connection.** The keyboard driving a generated
  sound is a `NoteInput`, which is a terminal, which is dropped at the module seam — so a
  patch whose pitch arrived by cable went silent the moment it became a module. The head of
  the pitch chain now carries the pitch as a parameter *and* takes the keyboard, and each
  covers what the other cannot. Related: **parameter ranges clamp on load**, silently. 19 of
  the 41 sfxr cases need a transpose beyond two octaves, and at the old ±24 the file would
  have kept the right number while the sound played at the wrong pitch — the same failure
  that cost time once already on `Slide`'s range.
- A **`WebAssembly.Module` cannot be cloned into an AudioWorklet** — separate agent
  cluster — and it fails silently, with no throw and no error event.
- **RTS-pulse resets are stateful** on the USB-Serial-JTAG bridge; the second pulse parks
  the chip in download mode. Opening the port is the reliable reset.
- **godot-cpp forces the static MSVC runtime**, so our libraries must be created after
  that is set or the link fails on duplicate CRT symbols.
- A Godot project must be **imported once** (`--import`) before its extension registers.
- **The web extension is a second build.** `runtime-godot/build` is the desktop DLL,
  `runtime-godot/build-web` is the wasm. Rebuilding only the first leaves the browser on a
  stale extension, and it fails nowhere near the cause: patches refuse to load because the
  engine "does not know about" a node type that plainly exists.
- **A service worker will serve you an old build for as long as a tab stays open.** Godot's
  worker is cache-first with no `skipWaiting`, so a waiting replacement never activates
  while a client is open. Unregister it before concluding anything about a re-export; check
  which `index.pck` size actually loaded first.
- **A click test's subject must be put on screen first.** The editor suite's synthesized
  clicks are computed from widget geometry, which is correct at any scroll — but the
  *delivery* is not: a press at y = -167 lands on nothing, and a press computed for a
  port that sits under the toolbar hits the toolbar. The face-edit block ran green for
  weeks on whatever scroll fit-on-load happened to choose, then one range widening
  (LFO amount to ±1000) grew every LFO readout's reservation, nudged every bbox, moved
  every fit — and nine checks went red on a pristine checkout, looking exactly like an
  environment failure. Centre the view on the subjects before clicking, aim inside
  child rects rather than by unzoomed pixel offsets, and treat "it fails on a clean
  tree" as "the test depends on something the tree does not pin", not as proof of a
  haunted machine. Related: `zoom_actual` now re-centres deferred with freshly-read
  rects, because the zoom's own detail change re-dresses the nodes a frame later.
- **An autowrap label with no pinned width reports its minimum height as if wrapped at
  zero width.** Inside a popup that sizes to content, one long `AUTOWRAP_WORD_SMART`
  label inflated the feedback dialog to the window's full height on first open — layout
  hadn't run yet, so the label answered "how tall am I?" for a width it would never have.
  Pin `custom_minimum_size.x` on any wrapping label that lives outside a ScrollContainer;
  the search dialog only escapes because its wrapping labels sit inside one.

## Plugins

The player plugin exists: one CLAP implementation in `runtime-clap`, assembled by
clap-wrapper into `SoundGraph.clap`, `SoundGraph.vst3` and `SoundGraph.component`.
State is the patch JSON; a stepped "Patch" parameter loads anything under
`$SOUNDGRAPH_PATCHES` or `~/Documents/SoundGraph/Patches`, driving a fixed surface of
32 normalised slots (see the decision log — VST3 forbids dynamic parameter sets, and
patches swap live through an atomic graph handoff, no host restart involved). Verified
three ways on the Mac: `auval -v aumu SgPl SnGr` passes render tests included, ctest
`clap_plugin_plays_and_swaps_patches` drives the bare CLAP through a patch swap, and a
scripted headless Reaper session (`REAPER -nosplash -new <script.lua>`) loads the VST3,
flips the selector by automation and renders audibly different audio. Opt in with

```bash
tools/get-plugin-sdks.sh        # once per clone
cmake -S . -B build -DSOUNDGRAPH_CLAP=ON && cmake --build build
```

The AU is verified inside GarageBand itself (2026-08-24, driven by screenshot-guided UI
automation): it appears under AU Instruments → SoundGraph, loads as a track instrument,
GarageBand maps the patch's declared controls onto its Smart Controls knobs (Cutoff,
Resonance, Sweep Rate…), plays live from Musical Typing, records, and an Export Song to
Disk render of the recorded region produced correct, non-silent audio.

The plugin has its own GUI (2026-08-24): a webview panel — SoundGraph wordmark "by
MutantFactory.net", patch selector, patch name, sliders for the bound controls — one
embedded panel.html served identically through the CLAP, the VST3 and the AU via choc
(vendored, ISC). Verified in GarageBand: the AU window shows the panel with restored
state, slider drags reach both the graph and host automation, and patch switches
re-render the surface live.

The Windows build of the same target shipped (2026-08-24, branch `dd/clap-host` via
`dd/midi-controller`): the VST3 and CLAP install per-user, and both were verified in
Reaper 7.79 — scanned, loaded, piano-roll sequenced, audible at the OS endpoint, the
selector showing patch names. The survey that led there is its own finding: on Windows
no healthy FOSS DAW hosts VST3 (Zrythm's packaging segfaults, LMMS has no VST3/CLAP and
its bundled Carla bridge crashes, OpenMPT is VST2-only) — Carla 2.5.10 works for rack
hosting but ships a corrupt default VST3 search path (fixed per-user in
`HKCU\Software\falkTX\Carla2\Paths`).

`sg-host` (2026-08-24, `plugin-host/`) is the first brick of SoundGraph-as-host: a
headless host that loads any `.clap` **or `.vst3`** the way a DAW does, walks the
factory, activates, plays notes, applies `--param NAME=VALUE` automation, renders to
WAV, and turns an RMS threshold into an exit code. Unlike `test_clap_plugin` it meets
the *shipped artifact* across the dynamic-loading boundary — a broken export table or
CRT mismatch cannot hide. `main.cpp` knows only `hosted_plugin.h`; the formats live in
`host_clap.cpp` and `host_vst3.cpp`, so a third format would not touch the driver.
Four ctests ride the CLAP build (`sg_host_plays_the_built_clap`,
`…_lists_the_parameter_surface`, `…_plays_the_built_vst3`,
`…_swaps_patches_through_the_vst3`).

Result worth keeping: rendering the same notes through the CLAP and through the VST3
produces **byte-identical WAV files**, so the wrapper is transparent on this path.

sg-host is not ours-only: pointed at Surge XT 1.3.4 (`C:\Users\danie\Tools\surge-xt\`,
plugins-only zip, no installer) it loads and plays both the VST3 and the CLAP, and
`--param "Global Volume=0.05"` takes a foreign synth to near silence. That first
third-party contact immediately found a bug of ours: `HostProcessData` allocates input
buses but does not clear them, so an *effect* — which our own instrument never exercised,
having no audio inputs — was handed uninitialised memory and processed it as audio.
Surge XT Effects roared at peak 2.0 given nothing at all. Inputs are now zeroed and
their `silenceFlags` set every block (in place processing is legal, so once is not
enough), and the same plugin now renders exact silence. No automated test covers this:
the repository cannot depend on a third-party plugin, so the guard is this note and the
comment in `host_vst3.cpp`.

Third-party plugins the host has been proven against, all as loose files under
`C:\Users\danie\Tools\` and none installed system-wide: **Surge XT 1.3.4** (instrument
and effects, VST3 + CLAP), **Dexed 1.0.1** (VST3 + CLAP, identical output through both
— and redundant as a DX7 oracle, since `tools/dx7-ref` already vendors msfa, which is
Dexed's own engine), and **ModulAir 1.3.3** (Full Bucket Music). ModulAir is the one
that matters most: it is hand-written C++ with no plugin framework, where Surge, Dexed
and Vital are all JUCE, so it is the only evidence that the loader is not quietly
JUCE-shaped. It also shows the two formats disagreeing about the same plugin — its VST3
publishes 722 normalised parameters plus a Preset selector, its CLAP 591 in plain units
(0..4, -24..24) and no selector at all.

Two things a headless host learns from strangers. **u-he Podolski**, extracted rather
than installed (its installer demands elevation), renders perfectly well and then
refuses to *end*: unable to find its data directory during teardown it opens a modal
message box, which no console host will ever dismiss. sg-host waited three minutes
before something else noticed. Hence `--timeout` (default 60 seconds, `0` waits
forever), a watchdog thread that exits 3 — distinct from silent (1) and misuse (2) —
and `SetErrorMode` for the system's own dialogs, though that does *not* cover a plugin
calling MessageBox itself, which is precisely what Podolski does. Only the watchdog
answers that. And plugins that ship installers rather than files cannot be added to a
test rig without a human at the UAC prompt.

The watchdog test then found a second bug of ours: `--seconds 200000` overflowed the
int32 frame count, so the render loop never ran and reported perfect silence — a test
rig failing in the one direction it must never fail. Frame counts are 64-bit now, and
audio is only accumulated when a `--wav` is actually going to be written.

Trap the tool found on its first day, and the reason `settle()` exists: on Windows
clap-wrapper services CLAP's `request_callback` from `onIdle`, which it drives from a
20 ms `WM_TIMER` on a message-only window (`detail/os/windows.cpp`). A headless host
pumps no message loop, so `on_main_thread` never ran and **patch switching through the
VST3 silently did nothing** — the render simply kept playing the old patch. Two things
were needed: pump the message queue from the host's main thread, and let real wall
clock pass, because an offline render finishes a second of audio in a few milliseconds
and would outrun a 20 ms timer even with a loop running. Any offline VST3 host of a
clap-wrapper plugin needs both; a live DAW never notices because its loop was always
running. `sg_host_swaps_patches_through_the_vst3` fails if either half is removed
(verified by removing it).

The Windows GUI works too (2026-08-24). It arrived as a black rectangle in both Reaper
and Carla, and the cause was neither host: choc builds a WKWebView synchronously on
macOS but asks WebView2 for an environment *asynchronously* on Windows, and both
`bind()` and `setHTML()` open with `if (! coreWebView) return false;`. Called at
gui_create time on Windows they were therefore not errors — they were silently
discarded, so the window existed and had simply never been told to show anything. The
panel setup now lives in `finish_gui_setup`, which is idempotent, refuses to act until
`isReady()`, and is driven by a registered CLAP host timer (with a bounded message pump
in `gui_set_parent` for hosts that offer no timer extension). One genuine second bug
sat underneath: choc creates its window `WS_POPUP`, and reparenting a popup into a
host's window without restyling it `WS_CHILD` leaves it painting unreliably — the style
has to change with the parentage. Verified in Reaper: both the CLAP and the VST3 show
the panel, the patch dropdown is populated through the JS bindings, and it opens.

Still open on the *player* plugin: sample-rate golden comparison through the plugin
path, audio input for HostAudioSource patches, and growing the panel toward hosting the
full web editor.

## SoundGraph as a host (2026-08-25)

The other direction: a patch invites somebody else's plugin in. `docs/hosted-plugins-design.md`
is the design and the decision log; this is the state.

**Two node types**, `PluginEffect` (stereo in and out) and `PluginInstrument` (notes in,
stereo out), each with sixteen slots that bind to the plugin's own parameters. A patch
carries a `plugins` table and each node names an entry, resolved **by identity** —
`org.surge-synth-team.surge-xt`, or a VST3 class UID — never by path. A machine without
that plugin still opens the patch: the effect passes its audio through, and one warning
names what is missing. That is the same stance dsp-core takes towards a target with no
provider at all, which is every target but the desktop.

`PluginInstrument` is a **voice boundary**: the replicator stops there, so one instance
hears every note and does its own voice allocation. Sixteen copies of Surge XT each
told to play the whole chord is not polyphony, it is sixteen wrong answers.

**The panel (2026-08-25).** The Godot extension links the hosting code and gives a
plugin one of Godot's own operating-system windows to draw in. Verified with Surge XT:
loaded in-process, plays (peak 0.37 on a held C), reports its editor at 2282x1422, and
paints its full interface inside a window Godot made. Three things that had to be
learned are written up in the design doc — Godot embeds its subwindows by default and
an embedded one has no OS window behind it; a plugin fills whatever it is handed, so it
gets a window of its own; and plugins ask in real pixels, DPI-aware, which is why Surge
asks `sg-host` for 1141x711 and Godot for 2282x1422 on the same screen.

The isolation rule bends here, on purpose. **Scanning** stays out of process — `sg-host
--scan` opens every plugin on the machine, which is the act that hangs — but a plugin
being *played* has to live where the audio graph is, and a plugin being *drawn* has to
live where the window is.

`plugin-host/plugin-host.cmake` is what made the link possible: the host library used
to be a guest in the plugin's build, borrowing clap-wrapper's `base-sdk-vst3`. It now
finds the SDKs and compiles the host-side subset of the VST3 SDK itself, so
`runtime-godot` — a separate configuration that has never heard of clap-wrapper — can
call `soundgraph_add_plugin_host()` too. Without the SDKs the extension is exactly what
it was, and says so at configure time.

**The bugs were ours, and pointing the tool at strangers' plugins is what found them.**
Effects were being handed uninitialised memory, which nothing had caught because our own
plugin is an instrument with no audio inputs and Surge's FX rack roared at peak 2.0. A
"negative parameter id means unbound" sentinel silently dropped most real CLAP ids —
Surge's Global Volume is `-810883302` — and for two stages that looked exactly like slot
control not working; only the exact `-1` a patch writes means unbound now.

**State is saved (2026-08-25).** A patch carries each plugin's own bytes — its preset,
its wavetable, everything a knob cannot say — base64 at the JSON boundary and raw
everywhere inside. The editor captures at the two moments that need it, reloading and
saving, and keeps the states beside the document rather than in it so that a plugin
rewriting itself never lands on the undo stack. Verified with Surge XT in the Godot
editor: a driven slot changes Surge's state, an unrelated graph edit rebuilds everything,
and the state that comes back is byte-identical.

Measured sizes, because the ceiling wanted a number rather than a feeling: Surge XT's
initial patch is 50 KB of state, Dexed's 6 KB, Surge's effects rack 1 KB. The editor
refuses above four mebibytes of base64 per plugin and says so — half a preset is not a
smaller preset.

**The panel resizes (2026-08-25).** Both directions. The host proposes and the plugin
answers with a size it can actually be — Surge XT, offered 1500x700, takes 1123x700
because it holds its aspect — and the window follows the answer. The plugin proposes too:
a zoom menu inside somebody else's editor arrives through CLAP's `request_resize` or
VST3's `IPlugFrame::resizeView`, is written down, and is collected on the editor's own
terms. Providing an `IPlugFrame` at all was new; the SDK wants `setFrame()` before
`attached()` and this host had never given one.

It found a real bug on the way: Surge's VST3 opens at 3312x2064 on this 4K screen, which
with a title bar exceeds the work area, so Windows maximised the window and left five
hundred pixels of Godot showing beside the editor. Clamping the window was the wrong half
of the pair — the fix is to ask the plugin to be smaller, with the decorations counted.

Plugin-to-host is implemented and unexercised: it needs a human to open a zoom menu.

**Delay compensation (2026-08-25).** A node's inputs must all describe the same
instant, so each node has an arrival time — the latest of its sources' output times — and
everything that would land early is delayed into line. Feedback edges are left alone;
they already carry the previous block, and delaying them would invent timing rather than
restore it. The graph's own output latency is reported rather than removed, because
nobody can hand back samples that do not exist yet: `sg-render` prints it, and the editor
says it once when it changes and keeps it in the status tooltip.

The invariant that matters more than the feature: a graph with no hosted plugin allocates
nothing, delays nothing, and produces the same samples it always did. It has its own test
rather than being left to the golden corpus to notice.

Reported latency is capped at one second with a warning, because the number comes from a
stranger and believing it means allocating whatever it said.

Nothing installed here has any lookahead — Surge XT reports zero for all thirty of its
effect types, checked by confirming the type parameter really landed — so the non-zero
case is proven against a fake plugin that is honestly late, in tests that go red when
compensation is removed.

`sg-host --save-state` / `--load-state` is how this was measured and is how it is tested:
`sg_host_saves_and_restores_plugin_state` runs three processes, because a plugin that is
never destroyed and reopened can round-trip by accident.

## The microphone (2026-08-26)

The Waveshare board's ES7210 dual-mic array is driven. It was described in the board
profile and read by nothing; the profile now also carries the channel count, the
generator emits an `SG_AUDIO_IN_*` block, and boards without capture hardware compile the
whole path out rather than carry a driver for something that is not there.

The I2S receive channel is asked for in the same `i2s_new_channel` call as the transmit
one, which is what makes them share a port and therefore a clock domain — one bclk, one
ws, one mclk, two data lines, exactly as the board wires it. Asking separately would want
a second port and the second port would find the pins taken. Bringing capture up is
deliberately not fatal: a board that cannot hear can still play, and it says so.

`esp_codec_dev` already carried the ES7210 driver, so this is configuration rather than a
register-level port. Only the two inputs the board wired are selected; the part is a quad
ADC used here for a pair, and selecting the other two mixes in two channels of nothing,
which reads as a quiet microphone rather than as a mistake.

**How it is verified, and why that shape.** A microphone is the one part of a board that
cannot be checked by reading a register — the chip reports itself present while the wire
from it is dead. So `mic [ms]` captures and reports level, DC offset and the strongest
frequency, and the check that settles it is the board listening to *itself*: silent
0.0026 rms, playing its own arpeggio 0.059 and 0.068 on the two channels with peaks
above 0.2, silent again 0.0024. Both channels move together; a dead one reads exactly
zero.

The frequency estimate is a Goertzel bank over the natural DFT bin centres of a
1536-sample window: 31.25 Hz apart, 31.25 Hz wide, covering 62 Hz to 5 kHz with nothing
falling between them. `tools/esp32/tone-check.py` closes the loop through the air — the
computer plays a tone, the board says what it heard — and 440, 1000 and 2500 Hz come back
as 438, 1000 and 2500.

**Two bugs on the way there, both worth keeping.** The first version swept 32
logarithmically-spaced bins across the whole capture, which made each one a filter 2.5 Hz
wide sitting in gaps 66 Hz apart at 440 Hz and 337 Hz apart at 2500 Hz. A tone registered
only if it landed almost exactly on a bin — and one did: a 1 kHz test tone read
perfectly, because bin 17 happened to be 999.7 Hz, while 440 and 2500 read as room rumble
with a clearly elevated level in the very same output. One confident right answer among
two confident wrong ones is the worst shape a diagnostic can have, and it is only
visible if the tones are chosen to disagree.

The second was performance. Tiling the spectrum properly meant far more bins, and in
double precision that is six million emulated operations — the ESP32-S3's FPU is
single-precision only, so every double is a library call. The console task held its core
long enough for the idle watchdog to call it a hang. Floats and a yield every sixteen
bins fixed it; nothing about a frequency readout ever needed more than a float.

Held notes from the board's own speaker still report the *second* harmonic at 220 and
440 Hz, and that one is not a bug: a 28 mm speaker does not radiate a fundamental that
low, so what reaches the microphone really is mostly the octave.

**Not done:** `AudioInput` nodes still see silence. Capture works and nothing routes it
into a graph yet.

## Command words, on the chip (2026-08-26)

The board listens for "Hi ESP" and then for one of six commands, entirely on its own
silicon. No audio leaves it, there is no network, and nothing is recorded — which is the
reason this is esp-sr on a microcontroller rather than a microphone pointed at somebody's
API. Espressif's stack does the work: WakeNet for the wake word, MultiNet7 English for the
commands, and the AFE cleaning the microphone up before either sees it.

**Where it sits.** `main/speech.cpp`, and nowhere near dsp-core. A voice command is a
*control source* in exactly the sense a button or a MIDI CC is: it reaches the graph
through the same verbs the console already uses, so "what happens when I say this" stays
the same question as "what happens when I type this". The core learns nothing about
speech. That is the split hosted plugins use on the desktop, applied again.

**What it cost.** The app went from 583 KB to 2.5 MB and needs a 3 M partition; the models
are another 3.05 MB in a `model` partition that esp-sr insists on finding by that exact
name. Total 7.4 M of the 8 M this firmware configures, which is what the smallest
supported board has — the Waveshare has 16 M and could be more generous, but the table is
shared. The recogniser wants 16 kHz and the graph runs the I2S at 48 kHz in one clock
domain, so the feed decimates three-to-one with a box filter on the way.

**The CPU question, answered.** All 21 golden cases still match with recognition running:
the audio task on core 0, the feed and fetch tasks on core 1. The DSP and the recogniser
genuinely fit on one chip.

**The bug worth keeping.** The command window was six seconds, on the reasoning that
somebody might need a moment. Saying the wake word every four and a half seconds then
produced detected, missed, detected, missed — perfect alternation, which is a state
machine and never a room. WakeNet is disabled while the window is open, so every second
wake word arrived at a recogniser still waiting for the first one's command. Somebody who
repeats the wake word has given up on the last one; the board should have too. Three and a
half seconds, and the alternation is gone.

**Several phrasings per command, because some words simply do not survive the model.**
"previous patch" measured nought out of three against a wake word that fired every time —
accepted by the model, then never matched. There is no way to see that by reading it. So
each command answers to more than one name, and "last patch" and "go back" both work.

**How it is verified.** `tools/esp32/voice-check.py` says every phrasing through the
Windows OS voice and reports what came back — and samples the microphone's noise floor
immediately before each attempt, because "the recogniser did not match" and "the room was
too loud to wake" look identical from outside. That distinction earned its keep at once: a
run that looked like steady decay was the room. The ten successful wakes sat at a floor of
0.0022 to 0.0029; the three failures at 0.0174, 0.0051 and 0.0153.

Latest clean run: **wake word 13/13, commands 9/13 phrasings, and all six commands
reachable** by at least one of their names.

### Being called by name (2026-08-26)

Say "hey mom" — no wake word — and the music ducks to 18% while the board answers "yes dear?" in
its own voice — a Speak & Spell LPC phrase, 194 bytes, played by a Speech node in
`examples/patches/yes-dear.json`. The reply is a *patch*, built once at boot into a second
Graph and mixed over the live one by the same audio task. The board answers using
SoundGraph, not a text-to-speech engine bolted to the side.

Verified the way the microphone makes possible: called by name, the board matched
"hey mom" and the mic then read rms 0.048 and peak 0.311 against a silent room at 0.0025.
It said the thing, and it heard itself say it. All 21 golden cases still match with the
reply mixer in the audio task and the front end beside it.

`tools/esp32/voice-check.py` now says every phrase without a wake word: nine to eleven of
sixteen phrasings depending on the room, and all seven commands reachable by at least one
of their names in every run.

**"Hey Mom" is a command rather than a wake word, and no wake word is needed.** WakeNet
words are pre-trained neural models; Espressif ships a fixed English list — Alexa, Hi ESP,
Computer, Hey Willow, Hey Wanda, Hey Ivy, Hey Ily, Hey Kira, Hi Andy, Hi Fairy, Hi Jason,
Hi Jolly — and `wn9_customword` is a placeholder for one they train to order. There is no
"Hey Mom" and none can be made here. So it had to be a command, and a command that answers
on its own has to be listened for continuously.

**That took two wrong conclusions to get right, and the second one was mine.** Matching
every chunk starved the idle task and the watchdog called it a hang; gating on the AFE's
voice detector fixed the quiet room and then overran the moment anybody spoke —
"Ringbuffer of AFE(FEED) is full". This was written up as "MultiNet is not realtime on
this chip", which is **wrong**, and it was wrong because it was never measured.

Measured, the matcher takes 25.7 ms against a 32 ms slice: **0.80x realtime**, with a
fifth of a core to spare. The problem was never speed. It was that both the front end —
the AFE's noise suppression *and* WakeNet, each running on every chunk — and the matcher
were pinned to core 1, while the watchdog dump showed core 0 sitting idle. Together they
do not fit on one core; apart they do. The front end now runs beside the graph on core 0
and the matcher has core 1 to itself, and all 21 golden cases still match with the front
end sharing the graph's core.

Two smaller things fell out of it. `CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_CHECK_IDLE_TASK_CPU1` is off,
because a core deliberately given over to a matcher has an idle task that genuinely does
not run and a watchdog looking for a fault this board does not have — Espressif set it the
same way in their own speech examples. And the `mic` console command now pauses listening
while it captures: two readers of one microphone split the stream between them, which
showed up as a noise floor of exactly zero, a reading that looks like broken hardware and
is a broken measurement.

The lesson is the cheap one to write and the expensive one to learn: "it does not fit" is
a measurement, not an impression, and a spare core is worth checking before believing the
first arrangement was the only one.

**It goes deaf as it gets louder, and echo cancellation does not fix that.**

Measured, asking it to hear "turn it down" over its own arpeggio, twice per volume:
volume 30 is 2/2, volume 45 is 1/2 to 2/2, volume 60 is 0/2. So it can be talked over
while it plays quietly and not while it plays loudly, which for a show floor is the wrong
half.

Echo cancellation was the obvious fix and it was built: this board has no hardware
loopback of its amplifier, but the audio task holds the exact samples it just sent, so
those become the reference channel, the front end runs as "MR" — one microphone, one
reference — and AEC joins the pipeline. All of it works, in the sense that it runs.

It buys nothing. With the canceller switched on and off at runtime against the same
volumes: 2/2 and 2/2 at 30, **1/2 and 2/2** at 45, 0/2 and 0/2 at 60. The same or slightly
worse, never better. The reference alignment was swept from 0 to 90 ms with no difference
at any setting, so it is not a timing mistake.

The likely reason is physical rather than fixable in software. The speaker sits a couple of
centimetres from the microphones and is driven hard, so what returns is not a delayed copy
of the reference but a distorted one, and a linear canceller cannot subtract distortion —
`AFE_TYPE_SR` says as much in its own documentation, and the pipeline duly reports
`NLP_OFF`. Turning it on also cost the always-listening mode, because the extra work
overflowed the feed ring and forced the matcher back behind a wake word: a real feature
traded for no measurable gain.

So it is off, behind `kUseEchoCancellation` in `speech.cpp` with those numbers written
beside it, and the plumbing is left standing for the next attempt. Worth trying:
`AFE_TYPE_VC`, which includes the nonlinear stage; a real loopback if the board is revised;
or simply moving the speaker away from the microphones.

**Continuous matching runs at the edge.** With the matcher on every chunk the feed ring
occasionally reports itself full, which means chunks are being dropped. Recognition still
works — that is what the numbers above are — but it is not comfortable, and the fix is
either a cheaper matcher or accepting the wake word back. Worth knowing before blaming a
missed phrase on the room.

**Not done.** "next patch" and "previous patch" are recognised and then print "not wired
yet": switching patches from the recognition task would rebuild the graph underneath the
audio task, and the console's own `load` path already solves that properly. It wants to go
through that rather than around it. There is also no echo cancellation — the front end is
configured for one microphone and no reference channel, because this board offers no
loopback of what its amplifier is doing, so recognising over its own output is a hardware
conversation as much as a software one.

## Axoloti: from roadmap footnote to shipping target (2026-08-25)

The "Axoloti/Ksoloti experiments" line item became, in one day of stations, a fifth
verified target and the first shipping soundgraph appliance. `embedded/axoloti/` holds
the whole rig; the board runs stock 1.0.12-2 firmware throughout — nothing reflashed,
patches link `--just-symbols` against the release elf whose CRC the board itself
reports.

**The rig.** The host speaks the board's vendor USB protocol directly from Python
(`driver/axoproto.py`) — no Java patcher anywhere. 70 hardware-in-the-loop tests in
eight tiers: USB link, memory programming, patch execution, analog loopback +
realtime limits, stress characterization, MIDI on all three transports, the SD card,
and sgaxo's golden verdicts. Everything skips cleanly with no board attached.

**The measurements.** Realtime knees: 176 raw integer oscillators, 48 faithful float
Sine nodes, 28 Sine→SVF→Gain voices. Stress bench: noise floor −66 dBFS, frequency
response flat ±0.1 dB across 50 Hz–20 kHz, SINAD ~47 dB and indifferent to load, zero
audio defects through load slams, USB hammering and combined soaks; SDRAM moves
24.6 MB/s of verified traffic cleanly and never corrupts a word even at CPU
overload. MIDI: 5.6 ms echo round trips, nothing dropped at 84% load.

**The compiler.** sgaxo turns editor patches into board binaries with patch-io as its
front-end (`sg-validate --resolve`: any schema version, module expansion, seams to
terminals, the engine's own execution order and feedback edges — scheduling defined
once). The kernel library restates every dsp-core inner loop; parameter-derived
transcendentals are host-computed in double and baked; the graph runs at the native
64-frame block size; `-ffp-contract=off` keeps rounding identical. The full
vocabulary compiles — oscillators, filters, envelopes, effects, SDRAM-backed
Delay/Comb/Allpass, Sampler (buffers shipped to SDRAM; the read head runs libgcc
soft-double and matches native bit for bit), the TMS5220 Speech node, and true
polyphony carrying graph.cpp's route_note allocator verbatim. Hosted plugins are the
one refusal, on physics.

**The verdicts.** 25 fidelity comparisons measured on the hardware against the shared
golden manifest and on-demand native renders: eleven manifest cases bit-exact
(sine, saw, square, both noises, lfo, adsr, delay-feedback through the SDRAM line,
ahd-envelope, arpeggio, noise-oscillator), Sampler and delay-echo bit-exact,
plucked-string 8.9e-8, Speech 2.4e-7, first-synth 2e-6, slide 9e-6, the 85-node
4-voice warehouse patch 2.5e-5 (rendered slower than realtime — capture correctness
survives overload). The residuals are understood, not mysterious: exp2-lattice phase
drift and fma-vs-two-roundings, each written down where it lives.

**The product.** `tools/bake-bank.py` bakes editor patches into a standalone SD
card: /start.bin boots at power-on, index.axb + MIDI Program Change walk the bank
through the firmware's own loader, sample and phrase buffers ride as sidecars the
patch FatFs-loads into SDRAM at init. Verified end to end on hardware, including the
cold boot: power-cycled with the card in, the board came up playing first-synth
autonomously.

**Traps that cost time, so they only cost it once:** the board fragments USB bulk
packets arbitrarily (keep partial-header tails when resyncing); patch `.data` is
NOLOAD in ramlink.ld (initialized statics arrive as garbage — the codegen refuses
them); gcc's `-freorder-functions` would emit sections the linker script never
places; a marginal USB cable brownout-crashes the board under load and impersonates
a patch bug — soak a known-good binary twice before believing any crash, and judge
the 5 V sysmon by steadiness, not level; transcendental polynomial constants must be
derived and measured in float32-Horner simulation, never recalled (a remembered
"minimax" cost 5e-3 on the slide golden); sg-render's note schedule is unsorted
on/off pairs whose delivery stops at the first not-yet-due action — mirror it in
list order; index.axb lines lose their last four characters and every line needs a
trailing newline.

## Invariants

- `dsp-core` depends on nothing but the C++ standard library.
- JSON never enters `dsp-core`; `patch-io` translates at the edge.
- No allocation, locks, or I/O in steady-state `process()`.
- No DSP in JavaScript and none in GDScript. Both editors are hosts.
- Neither editor keeps its own copy of the node vocabulary, the ranking, or the validator.
- The golden manifest is the single definition of correctness for every target.
