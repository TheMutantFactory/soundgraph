# Cosmopolitan Cables

The record of the cable pass, in the same discipline as the node pass: baseline first, then
one problem at a time, each goal changing a single variable and judged against a rendered
comparison before the next begins.

## What is in scope, and what is already finished

`docs/cable-design.md` is a **finished, frozen subsystem** and is not in scope. Ten goals
settled the material of one cable — mass, shell, glint, shadow, plug, cut-end mouth, colour
collar, deterministic hang, departure splay, crossing occlusion and surface response — each
against a rendered comparison, each freezing what came before it. Those figures stand.

This pass is a different layer: **routing and legibility in a dense field.** How a cable
behaves as one of thirty-five rather than as one cable.

The rule that carries over from the node pass, unaltered:

> **Colour, topology, focus, signal type, connection state and activity are separate
> channels. No treatment may make one of them carry another.**

That is the rule the node pass spent eleven steps learning, and a cable pass that ignores it
will rediscover every problem the node pass already solved.

## The seven problems

1. **Crossing ambiguity.** At dense intersections, especially same-colour ones, it takes
   effort to work out which strand continues through which path.
2. **Long-route ownership.** A cable crossing half the graph becomes visually detached from
   both its ends.
3. **Colour-only type information along the span.** The endpoints carry socket shape; the
   middle of a cable carries hue and nothing else.
4. **Cable hierarchy.** Every ordinary cable demands about the same attention, whether it is
   the main audio path, a secondary modulation, or one of twenty event connections.
5. **Dense bundles.** Parallel and near-parallel runs accumulate into visual mass rather
   than behaving like organised routes.
6. **Occlusion at nodes.** Socket termination is settled; a cable passing behind or beside
   an unrelated node still complicates local reading.
7. **MAP behaviour.** At 28–40% the cables are a larger share of what is left, so their
   grammar matters more exactly where the node grammar has stood down.

## Step 1 — the baseline

`cable_baseline.gd`, against `editor-godot/qa/dense-graph.json` — the hostile specimen built
for the node pass's 15B. Deliberately not a new, friendlier cable card: it already has the
long crossings, the fan-outs, the multi-input mixing and the density.

```bash
CABLE_BASELINE_OUT=/tmp/p godot --headless --path editor-godot --script cable_baseline.gd
```

It measures rather than describes, because six of the seven problems are about density and
density is what an impression is worst at.

```

```

Archived at `docs/proofs/cable-baseline.json`, with every crossing's position, angle and
colour pair, every cable's detour ratio, and every trespass.

### What the baseline already changed about the plan

Three of the seven problems came back much smaller than they look, and one came back
differently shaped. That is the whole reason to measure before designing.

**Shallow crossings do not exist here — zero of thirty-two.** The expectation going in was
that grazing intersections would be the hard ones, and the catenary routing has already
solved that: Goal 6's per-cable hang and Goal 7's alternating departure splay push
neighbours apart, so every crossing in the specimen is transverse. **Problem 1 is therefore
not about angle. It is about the fifteen same-colour crossings**, which meet at perfectly
readable angles and are still ambiguous because both strands are the same mint.

That is a much narrower target than "crossing treatment", and it points somewhere specific:
whatever is done at a junction has to distinguish two cables that are *identical in every
channel except which one is on top*.

**Bundles are two pairs, not a problem.** Goal 7's splay is doing its job. Problem 5 may be
a problem in patches with wider fan-outs than this one, and the honest position is that the
specimen does not demonstrate it. Do not design for it on this evidence.

**Trespass is three.** Problem 6 is real and rare. Three cables pass through a node's
territory that has nothing to do with them.

**Cable share is flat at 2.3%, and that is the finding.** The cord width scales linearly
until `maxf(8 * zoom, 2.4)` puts a floor under it below a zoom of 0.3, so cables hold
exactly their share of the picture at every distance and gain 0.1 point at 28%. So **problem
7 is not cables getting heavier. It is everything else getting lighter** — at MAP the nodes
shed their controls, their values and eventually their port names, and the cables are left
carrying a larger share of the *remaining information* while carrying an unchanged share of
the *ink*. Reducing cable weight at MAP would be solving the wrong half.

**Problem 2 stands, and has a figure.** The longest cable is 2955 units against a median of
357 — eight times — in a patch 4016 units wide. One cable crosses three quarters of the
graph.

## The first question

> **How does a single route stay identifiable through a dense field without making every
> route louder?**

Three techniques, tested separately and in this order:

1. **Crossing treatment** — a bridge, gap or halo at intersections so continuity is
   obvious. Aimed at the fifteen same-colour crossings, which is now known to be the whole
   of problem 1. Goal 8 already established that occlusion plus a local halo works; the
   question is whether it is enough when both cables are the same colour.
2. **Focus treatment** — hovering or selecting a cable or a socket **suppresses unrelated
   cables** rather than brightening the chosen one. Suppression rather than emphasis,
   because emphasis is another way of making the graph louder and the whole point is that
   it should get quieter.
3. **Sparse type marking** — very infrequent inline semantic marks or texture, as the
   grayscale fallback for problem 3. **Only after crossings work**, and deliberately last.

## Goal 1 — crossing separation

**Not "improve crossings".** The measured defect is narrow, and the goal is stated as the
narrow thing:

> At a transverse crossing between visually identical cables, a reader can immediately tell
> which strand continues through the intersection.

Nothing else moved: not width, routing, splay, bundling, MAP scaling or node trespass. The
route geometry and the connection coordinates are untouched; the treatment is a drawing.

Named **crossing separation**, not "bridge". A bridge is one candidate's geometry and the
name would have smuggled it in.

### The exclusion the incumbent had lost

Before any candidate was drawn, the sheet found something the baseline had not: the cord
layer was treating **fan-out convergences as crossings.** Cables leaving one output or
arriving at one input meet by design, and a separation mark there says the opposite of what
is true — the clock's three-way fan-out was being marked as three crossings. GraphEdit's own
thin-line crossing pass had that exclusion; the cord layer that replaced it never did.

Restoring it took the specimen from 31 crossings to 27, and the same-colour set from 16 to
12. Four of the sixteen "hard cases" were cables that genuinely join.

### The four columns

| | what it does | pixels | ink added | ink removed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| none | nothing — the reference | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| halo | darker halo under the upper cable (the incumbent, goal 8) | 659 | 0 | 117 |
| **knockout** | **lower cable erased for a short span, upper drawn over the gap** | **1359** | **22** | **229** |
| bump | upper cable lifted into a local arc | 10477 | 1391 | 1086 |
| knockout, every crossing | the unconditional rule | 4468 | 64 | 759 |

Measured at the crossings rather than across the frame. The frame-wide diff was tried first
and was not reproducible — three runs gave 908, 940 and 890 touched pixels for one treatment,
because something else in the editor moves between captures. The crops are taken back to back
at one scroll position with nothing changed but the construction, and they repeat to within a
pixel.

### What the sheet showed

**Knockout wins, as expected, and the reference column is what makes the case.** With
nothing at all, two identical blue strands fuse into a lozenge at the crossing and there is
no way to tell which continues. **The halo barely changes that** — darkening the upper
cable's underside says nothing when the cable underneath is the same colour, which is
precisely the case it was never tested on. The knockout reads immediately as one line
passing over another, and it does it with twenty-two units of added ink across twelve
crossings.

**The bump loses on both counts.** It adds sixty-three times the ink, and it says something
untrue: the cable visibly detours around another cable, and the route is a fact about the
patch. It also reads as printed-circuit crossover notation, which is a different language
from a patch cord.

At 40% and 28% the treatment is invisible, which is the intended behaviour — almost nothing
until you need to trace a route.

### The constraints, and how they are met

| Constraint | How |
|---|---|
| never resembles an electrical junction | nothing is drawn *at* the crossing; a gap is cut. No dot, no ring, no taper — anything that closes across the gap becomes a junction mark |
| implies no direction | the gap is symmetric about the intersection and follows the lower cable's own path |
| encodes no type, activity, selection or focus | it is one shape in the ground colour, and it appears at every qualifying crossing regardless of what the cables carry |
| route geometry unchanged | the knockout is a drawing pass; `_get_connection_line` is untouched. Only the bump displaces anything, and even it draws from a copy |
| local to the crossing | the gap is the upper cable's width plus clearance either side, `span_at` walks the path to that length, and `editor_test` holds it at exactly that |
| deterministic priority | connection order, which is the file's order — the same rule the layer already used, and nothing semantic invented about which cable deserves to be on top |

### Goal 1.1 — unconditional, and the grammar closes

Both rules were rendered and the conditional one lost on **meaning**, not on ink.

What a knockout says is *these two paths cross here; they do not join*. That is true of a
blue over a blue and equally true of a blue over a green. Applying it only where the hues
coincide makes its presence a fact about the palette rather than about the graph — an
unexplained channel that looks like it means something and whose real rule no reader can
recover. The cost of dropping the condition was forty-two ink units across fifteen more
crossings, and neither the 100% nor the 40% frame shows an artefact from it.

The rule, final:

```
true transverse crossing          knockout
shared endpoint, fan-out          never
an actual junction                never
colour                            irrelevant
z-order                           connection order; deterministic, and means nothing
```

Which leaves the crossing grammar as small as it can be:

> **A gap means a crossing. A continuous meeting means a connection.**

**Goal 1 is frozen.**

## Goal 2 — route focus by suppression

Aimed at the long-route problem the baseline measured. The mechanism is a prohibition:

> **The focused cable is drawn at its ordinary resting appearance.** No extra width, no
> saturation, no glow, no brightening. Focus works because the noise leaves.

Two questions, kept separate. **Cable hover** focuses one connection. **Port hover** focuses
everything plugged into that one port, because an output with three cables on it really is
one source feeding three destinations and should read as a family. Neither propagates
through a node: a cable graph is not a semantic signal chain, and lighting the whole
downstream network is a different feature with a different meaning.

Crossings are untouched. A dimmed cable still crosses rather than joins, and which cable is
over does not depend on what the pointer is doing — that would make focus mutate geometry.
Nodes are untouched entirely, so that this step answers about cables alone.

### The mechanism had to change, and that is the finding

Alpha was the obvious implementation and it does not work. A cord is **six stacked passes**
— two shadows, two shell strokes, a body and a highlight — and scaling each one's alpha
independently leaves the composite far more opaque than the number says:

```
                alpha-scaled          mixed toward the ground
nominal      background   ratio       background   ratio
  0.65          0.905      1.11          0.814      1.23
  0.45          0.820      1.23          0.710      1.41
  0.25          0.697      1.44          0.608      1.64
```

At a nominal 45% the alpha version bought a 1.23 luminance ratio, and the three specimens
were nearly the same picture — the number meant nothing. Mixing each coloured pass toward
the canvas instead gives a reduction that lands where it is asked to. Hue direction, width
and path are untouched; what changes is contrast against the ground.

### The level

**0.25 ships, and it was not the expected winner.** The prior was 40–50%, and that was a
good prior for a mechanism that delivers its nominal figure. This one delivers less, so the
same effect needs a lower number.

The figure to carry forward is **the achieved ratio, 1.64**, not the nominal 0.25. If the
mechanism changes again, re-derive the nominal from the ratio.

At 0.25 on the hostile graph at 40%, the focused route threads unmistakably from the
keyboard down to Speak, and every suppressed cable is still visible with the topology of the
rest of the patch intact. Nothing has vanished, which is the stated win condition — the
quietest background that still leaves the network there. At 0.45 the focused route is hard
to pick out of the field.

### What was measured, not eyeballed

```
focused keeps      1.002 / 1.000 / 0.998    the prohibition, at all three levels
routes             point-identical in graph space, focused and not
crossings          same count, same positions, focused and not
cable hover        exactly one connection unsuppressed
port hover         exactly the cables on that port
nodes              2 sampled pixels, on one short cable near a node edge
```

### Three instruments were wrong before one was right

Worth recording, because every one of them failed the same way — **a reference frame is only
a reference for as long as nothing has moved, and in a live program that is about four
frames.**

1. The luminance ratio compared the focused cables against the background cables. They are
   different cables carrying different signals and mint is brighter than periwinkle: at 65%
   suppression it reported the background as *brighter* than the focus.
2. The node check diffed against a resting frame from the top of the run and reported a
   floor of 33 changed pixels rising to 180 by the end **in the baseline scene**, where
   nothing is focused. Not jitter — drift, something in the editor settling over minutes.
3. With the reference fixed, the focused set still read 0.505. The port-hover cables sit
   off-screen at 100% in a patch four thousand units wide, and their empty readings were
   being averaged in as "this cable is black".

All three are now measured from one before/after pair captured back to back, with the view
centred on the cables being asked about.

## Goal 3.0 — the signal taxonomy audit

Goal 3 stalled because the hostile patch produced two classes where the cue design assumed
three. Before drawing a third grammar: is there a third semantic class?

`signal_audit.gd` enumerates every port on every runtime type.

```
182 ports across 51 runtime types

declared      count      shape       colour   transport
audio            78     circle       57e3b4   stream
control         104    diamond       8fb8ff   stream

0 of those declare no type at all and fall back to control
types carrying a message port at all: none
cables in the hostile patch, by class: { control: 17, audio: 18 }
```

### The answer is B, and it is unambiguous

`dsp-core/include/soundgraph/types.h` has four types and the distinction is real:

> audio and control are both sample streams and interconvert freely. **event and note carry
> discrete messages and require an exact type match.**

`signal_types_compatible` enforces exactly that. And **no node uses it.** In all of
`dsp-core/src`, `SignalType::Event` and `SignalType::Note` appear only in the two functions
that turn them into strings and back. Not one of 182 ports declares either, and not one
falls back to a default — every declaration is explicit.

So this is not a handful of misdeclared ports, which is what a data bug looks like. It is a
policy, applied without exception: **gates and triggers are transported as float streams**,
which is what lets an LFO be a clock and an audio signal be a trigger.

The consequence for the cables is simple, and it makes goal 3 easier rather than harder:

> **SoundGraph has two cable classes. Continuous is audio; a sparse cadence is control.
> There is no paired event cadence, because there is no event.**

The invariant that follows:

> **Cable type is derived from signal semantics in the graph model, never inferred from
> socket shape or colour.**

If a node ever declares an event or note port, goal 3 reopens — deliberately, at the
derivation, rather than a cable quietly inventing a third grammar off a socket shape.

### The mismatch worth recording

The socket grammar advertises **four shapes for two realities**. Square and ring are drawn
by the editor, mapped by `_slot_type`, and unreachable: no port produces them. Likewise the
trigger colour never reaches a cable.

That is dead vocabulary, not an inadequate rule, so it does not reopen the frozen node
grammar. It belongs in `docs/known-issues.md` as a taxonomy question for whenever the signal
model is next opened.

## Goal 3 — grayscale cable type

### The proving ground

`editor-godot/qa/cable-types.json`, and it does **not** replace the hostile graph. Two long
cables of each real class across empty canvas, endpoints far enough apart that a mid-span
crop holds cable and nothing else, plus one crossing pair. The same split that worked for
the nodes:

```
type specimen   can the vocabulary be read at all?
dense graph     does it stay calm in a real patch?
```

### The test is 100% only, and that is a finding

At 40% a 340-pixel crop of a patch four thousand units wide contains nodes wherever it is
centred — four of the first sheet's six crops answered a different question. And at MAP
scale a cable exists to say topology *in context*; an isolated crop of one is not what
anybody is looking at.

```
100%            endpoint-free grayscale identification
66 / 40 / 28%   whole-graph integration
```

### The result

| | cues | refused | cadence px | ink /1000px |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| none | 0 | 0 | — | 0 |
| highlight | 31 | 1 | 162 | **−876** |
| **ribs** | 31 | 1 | 162 | **+61** |
| stamps | 31 | 1 | 162 | +92 |

**The ribs win, and neither prior survived.**

- **none** — the two classes are the same picture. The defect, confirmed.
- **highlight** — the preferred first specimen, and it fails. Spending the existing sheen is
  elegant and costs *negative* ink, and the interruption it produces cannot be found without
  knowing where to look. Elegant is not the criterion.
- **stamps** — legible, and fails the other half: a diamond beside a cable reads as a
  connector or a very small node, exactly as predicted.
- **ribs** — small, quiet, plainly visible, and read as marks *on* the cable rather than
  objects beside it. At 100% in the hostile graph they are barely noticeable and nothing
  about the patch reads as decorated.

Against the brutal criterion — *if a candidate cannot distinguish every real cable class at
100% grayscale without explanation, it does not solve goal 3* — only the ribs pass.

### The blind test

`blind_cues.gd` exports endpoint-free grayscale crops under shuffled names, seeded from the
clock so the order is not a property of the file, writes the key to `answers.json`, and
prints nothing that would give it away. Fourteen crops from four cables, taken at four
fractions along each so the mark is not always near the middle, including two that sit at a
crossing.

**Fourteen of fourteen**, on an eight-audio, six-control split. Chance is a coin.

Every call was made from the mark being *present or absent*, not from hunting: a control
crop shows one or two small ticks and an audio crop shows a clean span, and at 2× on a
300-pixel crop that is a glance rather than a search. Which is the bar — substantially
better than chance and unambiguous once noticed, for a redundant channel rather than the
primary classifier.

One crop was called with low confidence and it is the honest residual: **crop-10 sat inside
a crossing, where the exclusion refuses a rib, so an unmarked span there means either
audio or a control cable whose cue was suppressed.** It happened to be audio. The
neighbouring crop-12 is also at a crossing and does show its rib just clear of the
knockout, so the exclusion is local enough that it rarely blinds a whole crop — but a crop
taken exactly on a junction cannot be classified, and that is a property of the design
rather than a defect in it. The precedence is deliberate: crossing geometry outranks the
type cue.

**Goal 3 is frozen.**

### What holds

```
cadence      162 screen px achieved against a 160 target
placement    31 cues, 1 refused by the exclusions
routes       point-identical with and without a cue
crossings    same count, same positions
focus        the focused cable byte-equivalent, cue included
```

## The resting cable grammar, frozen

```
continuous unmarked span      audio
sparse transverse rib         control
a gap                         two paths cross and do not join
a continuous meeting          a connection
suppression                   focus prominence, and nothing else
```

Five statements. Everything else a cable does — its mass, shell, glint, shadow, plug, hang
and departure splay — was settled by the ten goals in `docs/cable-design.md` and is not part
of this vocabulary.

## Goal 4 — persistent focus

**Behavioural, not visual.** The invariant, and it is the whole of the goal:

> **Transient and persistent focus render identically. Persistence changes lifetime, never
> appearance.**

There is no locked colour, border, glow or width. A sixth cable channel for "this focus is
pinned" would undo the discipline the previous three goals established, and if a reader
needs to know the focus is locked, that belongs somewhere outside the wire.

### The grammar

```
hover a cable         transiently focus that connection
hover a port          transiently focus every cable on that port
click a cable         pin it; clicking it again lets go
click a port          pin its family; clicking it again lets go
Escape                let go
click empty canvas    let go
```

**Model B: the lock is home and hover previews.** Hovering another route while one is pinned
shows the other; taking the pointer away comes home to the pinned one. The alternative — a
lock that ignores hover — is more predictable and makes comparing two routes a matter of
unlocking and relocking, which is the gesture the lock existed to save.

A lock is an **identity**, not a position, so it survives zoom and pan for free. What it
does not survive is the route being disconnected underneath it: `prune_focus_lock()` runs on
every rebuild, because a stale reference would leave the field quieted around nothing at
all. Opening a document clears it outright.

Escape lets go of a pinned focus *before* it panics the instrument. Escape is the key for
"never mind", and letting go of a focus is a smaller never-mind than silencing everything.

### What is gated, and the one thing that is not

```
a locked route focuses exactly what hovering it focuses
hovering another route while one is locked previews the other
taking the pointer away comes home to the locked one
a locked port focuses exactly what hovering it focuses
letting go leaves the field undisturbed
a route that no longer exists takes its lock with it
```

**The click gestures themselves are not verified by the suite.** Headless Godot has no input
routing, so what the suite holds is that the lock functions focus the right sets; that a
press-and-release on a cable or a socket reaches them is a claim about input plumbing and
wants a windowed check by hand. The socket case is the less certain of the two, because
GraphEdit owns port presses for connection dragging and this only notices a press that went
nowhere.

## Closure

The windowed gesture probe first, because goal 4 shipped with its gestures ungated.
`cable_gestures.gd` pushes real events through `Input.parse_input_event` in a real window —
headless has no input routing at all, and a check that passed there would be a check of an
empty room.

**Fourteen of fourteen**, including the case that was least certain: **the port click works.**
GraphEdit owns port presses for making cables, and noticing only a press that went nowhere
turns out to be enough — clicking a socket pins its family, clicking again lets go, and
dragging from one neither pins anything nor leaves a stray cable behind.

Three of the probe's own first four failures were the probe: a point on a cable that passes
behind a node never reaches GraphEdit at all, because a GraphNode consumes its own motion.
And the cable point has to be derived from `graph._routes()`, which is what `_connection_at`
picks against — deriving it from the drawing and testing it against the picker is two
implementations of one route.

### The closure matrix

`cable_closure.gd`, over both specimens, four zooms and two palettes: **278 invariants, no
complaints.**

```
route points unchanged by focus, by a lock, or by a type cue
crossing count and locations unchanged by any of them
no crossing sits on a shared port
every rib gap exactly the cadence, at every zoom
no rib inside an exclusion zone
the focused cable, ribs included, identical to its resting self
persistent and transient focus render identically
no node pixel changes because of cable focus

dense-graph prominence   1.81
cable-types prominence   1.27
```

Two findings from the matrix, both about measurement rather than design.

**The prominence ratio is a property of the scene, not a constant.** 1.64 was measured
across five focus scenes on the hostile graph; one scene on it gives 1.81, and the sparse
type specimen gives 1.27 because most of its suppressed set is short. Asserting a single
number across specimens was the wrong assertion. What holds everywhere is a floor, and the
matrix holds it at 1.2.

**And ten node pixels at 66% were three node corners.** The check inset the node rectangle
by fourteen pixels — the cord's outer extent — and reported ten sampled pixels across Scale
Quantizer, Drive and Comb at one band and nowhere else. A node's *rectangle* is not a node's
*drawn body*: the panel is rounded and inset inside its frame, so a cable passing under a
corner is visible within the rect while being nowhere near anything a reader would call the
node. At twenty-two the figure is zero. Five instruments have now been wrong in this pass
and every one of them the same way — the measurement standing for the thing rather than
being it.

**The cable pass is complete.** `docs/graph-cable-system.md` is the specification.

### What not to start with

Dashed control cables, or any repeating pattern. With thirty-five intersecting cables, a
reasonable pattern becomes plaid, and the pattern then competes with the crossing treatment
that problem 1 actually needs. The grayscale gap is real and it is filed in
`docs/known-issues.md`; it is third in the queue and not first.
