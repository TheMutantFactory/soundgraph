# The Graph Node Pass

Making the graph read as one technical instrument rather than as miniature synth panels.
Built in steps, each rendered and reviewed before the next, the way the cable renderer and
the Add Node browser were. See `docs/cable-design.md` and `docs/add-node-browser.md`.

The rule the whole pass answers to:

> At reduced zoom, remove information before reducing its legibility. Never solve density
> by shrinking meaningful text into noise.

## Step 1 — the baseline

`editor-godot/graph_baseline.gd` takes it. Four zooms, one patch, every measurement
written to a file rather than read off a picture, because "the same patch opens the same
way afterwards" is a claim about numbers:

```
godot --path editor-godot --script graph_baseline.gd     # GRAPH_BASELINE_OUT names the folder
```

First Synth, 1440x900, XL interface, adaptive detail:

```
node   title              size in graph space   ports in/out
n0     Keyboard           479 x 257             1 / 4
n1     Main Oscillator    339 x 211             3 / 1
n2     Filter Sweep       430 x 119             1 / 1
n3     Lowpass            488 x 257             4 / 1
n4     Amp Envelope       388 x 119             1 / 1
n5     Amplifier          225 x 165             2 / 1
n6     Output             392 x 165             2 / 1
```

Seven nodes, seven wires. Widths run from 225 to 488 — every node is as wide as its
contents made it, which is what step 8's width classes are for.

### What each zoom actually shows

```
zoom   detail band   controls drawn   titles cut
100%   FULL          66               0 of 7
 66%   COMPACT       24               0 of 7
 40%   SUMMARY        0               3 of 7
 28%   SUMMARY        0               4 of 7
```

At 40% and 28%: `Main Oscilla…`, `Amp Envelop…`, `Amplifi…`, then `Main Osc…`,
`Filter Swe…`, `Amp Env…`, `Ampl…`. This is the failure the plan names, and it has a
mechanism rather than an accident behind it.

### Where the ellipsis comes from

The editor already has two answers to zoom, and they are not the same thing:

**The detail bands** — `PatchGraph.level_for()`, FULL / COMPACT / SUMMARY / TOPOLOGY at
0.60 and 0.40 with a hysteresis of 0.02. This is already step 12's idea: at 66% the node
sheds parameter rows (66 controls to 24), at 40% it sheds them all. It works.

**The compensated title** — under a screen minimum (`MIN_SCREEN_NODE_TITLE`, 16px before
the UI scale, so 22px at XL) the node's own title Label is hidden and `ScreenText` draws
the name at that pinned size instead, in `node.size.x * zoom - 12` pixels of room, elided
to fit. That is the right instinct — the name stays legible while the node shrinks — with
the wrong last step: when the pinned name does not fit the shrinking node, it is cut.

So the two systems disagree at the bottom. The bands remove information as they should;
the title refuses to, and pays for it in characters. Nothing here is a rendering bug, and
nothing is fixed by a smaller font: at 28% the Amplifier node is 63 screen pixels wide and
its name at the legibility floor wants 96.

That is the finding step 12 has to answer, and the shape of the answer is in the plan
already: **an intentional short name, not an ellipsis.**

### Two other things the baseline turned up

The lens switch floats over the canvas at the top right, so nodes scroll underneath it —
at 40% the Output node sits behind `Graph | Schematic`. It is a chrome question rather
than a node one, and it is recorded here because a screenshot of the graph at low zoom
will keep showing it.

`Design.MIN_SCREEN_*` rises with the interface scale, so an XL reader reaches every band
sooner and hits the elision earlier. Anything measured in this pass is measured at XL,
which is the tightest case.

### What may not change

Pinned in `editor_test.gd`: First Synth is those seven nodes with those port counts, and
the document holds seven wires. Surfaces, type, icons and what survives a zoom are all in
scope; what the patch *is* is not, and the way that goes wrong is a port quietly gained or
lost while somebody is looking at the colours.

## Step 3 — the canonical anatomy, on three nodes

Gain, StateVariableFilter and ADSR — the Amplifier, the Lowpass and the Amp Envelope of
First Synth. Nothing else takes the anatomy until these are approved, which is what a
proving ground is for. `NodeIdentity.PROVING_GROUND` is the list, and it is the only
place the scope is written down.

### The four parts

```
header    identity: the name, mixed case, left, in a region of its own
body      one surface step under the header, one over the canvas
ports     sockets on the perimeter, labels inside, unchanged this step
control   the body's padding, one gutter figure on each axis
```

Surfaces are the application's own and one step apart each: canvas `0f1318`, body
`1b212a`, header `252d38` on Lab — about five points of luminance between neighbours,
which is the plan's 5–8%. One hairline under the header, because without it the two greys
meet and read as a gradient rather than as two parts. One crisp perimeter. No paint, no
gradient, no shadow: the rack draws modules as hardware and is right to, and a diagram
made of photographs of panels is two languages in one window.

The header stopped being a strip behind a word. It has a height of its own
(`ANATOMY_HEADER`), so a long name and a short one get the same identity region, and the
name is **mixed case, left-aligned** — capitals and centring came from the panel pass,
where a centred legend in capitals is what a faceplate has. `AMPLIFIER` is a label on a
box; `Amplifier` is what the thing is called. Small capitals keep their job for the
metadata under the name.

### Canonical and compact names

`node_identity.gd`. Every node has the name its author gave it and, if its type has been
through the pass, a compact name written down beside it:

```
Gain                  Amp
StateVariableFilter   Filter
ADSR                  Envelope
```

Keyed by **type**, not by the name on the node: somebody who renames their oscillator
"Bass" still gets a compact identity, because what the node *is* has not changed, and an
author cannot be asked to invent a short form for every node they name.

The drawing rule, in `ScreenText._name_for`: the canonical name whenever it fits, at every
size. When it does not, the written-down compact name. Only when there is neither does
anything get cut — so a cut name is now the mark of a type that has not been through the
pass, rather than the normal way of drawing a small node.

Two departures from the table in the brief, both because the key is the type: the brief's
`Amplifier → Amp` is `Gain → Amp` here, and `Lowpass → Lowpass` never fires because
`Lowpass` fits at every zoom — its type's compact is `Filter`, for the day a filter is
named something longer. `Filter Sweep → Sweep` is not in this step at all: the LFO has not
been through the pass, and its compact word is a question for when it is.

### Measured, before and after

Same harness, same patch, same window, same XL scale. The before run has `main.gd`
stashed, so both columns are measured by the same code — the first attempt compared the
new renderer against an approximation of the old one and reported changes in nodes
nothing had touched.

```
topology      7 nodes, 7 wires, no moves, no port changes
sizes         Lowpass 488x257 -> 482x239, Envelope 388x119 -> 382x101,
              Amplifier 225x165 -> 219x147     (the control region's own padding)
100%, 66%     no title changes
40%           'Amp Envelo…' -> 'Envelope'      'Ampli…' -> 'Amp'
28%           'Amp En…'     -> 'Envelope'      'Am…'    -> 'Amp'
```

Titles at 28%: three canonical, two compact, two cut. The two still cut are Main
Oscillator and Filter Sweep, which have not been through the pass — visible, in the same
patch, beside two that have.

### Not in this step

The adaptive bands are untouched: the same 0.60 and 0.40, the same hysteresis, the same
counts at every zoom. Cables, serialisation, node ids, control values and the other four
node types are as they were. Width classes are step 8, so nothing was widened to make a
name fit — the compact name is the answer at this size, by design.

## Step 4 — the internal grid

`node_grid.gd` holds every figure the inside of a node is built from. Before it they were
spread through the builder — `SPACE_M` here, a bare `0` there, a row height that happened
to be 74 — and the result was what you would expect: controls that had each been nudged
until they looked right on whichever node somebody was looking at.

```
INSET_X       12    body edge to anything inside it, and the header's own inset
INSET_TOP      8    under the header's rule, before the first row
INSET_BOTTOM   8    under the last row, before the body's foot
ROW_GAP        8    between rows
COLUMN_GAP    16    between controls on a row, and between a port label and the controls
COLUMN        84    one control column, shared by every cell
LABEL_GAP      4    control to its name
VALUE_GAP      4    name to its value
CELL_ROW      72    a row carrying controls
PORT_ROW      24    a row carrying only ports
```

Eights, or fours where the gap is inside one object rather than between two. `CELL_ROW`
and `PORT_ROW` were 74 and 28 — near enough to the rhythm to look deliberate, far enough
off it to put every row below them half a unit out.

### What was actually wrong with the Lowpass

Not the spacing. The controls sat in a box that expands to fill, centred between two port
labels of different lengths — so `mod` on one row and `cutoff Hz` on the next moved the
whole control block sideways, and two tidy rows read as four islands.

**The gutters are equal within a node and measured from that node's own longest port
label.** Equal, so the control region has one left edge and one right edge on every row;
measured per node, because a fixed figure is a width class in disguise — 88px was tried,
and the Amplifier, which has two short port names and one knob, went from 219 to 314
holding two gutters sized for a node it is not.

With that, cutoff sits over mode and resonance over sweep: two rows, by rule rather than
by nudging.

### The three specimens

```
Gain        one column, two ports      219x147 -> 231x150
ADSR        a regular 2x2              382x101 -> 400x101
SVF         mixed two-column           482x239 -> 500x248
```

Twelve to eighteen pixels wider, from the gaps: `COLUMN_GAP` is 16 where the old
separation was 12, and it is paid twice on a row. Three pixels taller on two of them, from
the micro gaps inside the cells. `COLUMN` is 84 rather than the 104 tried first, because
84 is the floor the builder already used for a name box — the column is not there to make
cells wider, it is there to make them the same.

The simple node stayed simple: the Amplifier is 231 wide, not 314.

### Measured

Topology unchanged: seven nodes, seven wires, no moves, no ports gained or lost. The other
four node types are untouched. Detail bands identical at every zoom. One title changed at
40% — `Amp Envelope` now fits its canonical name in a node eighteen pixels wider, so it no
longer needs its compact one. That is a consequence of the grid rather than a width class,
and it is recorded here because the next person to read the title numbers will wonder.

## Step 5 — control typography

`node_text.gd` holds six roles and every decision about face, size and colour that goes
with them. They were being made where each label was built, which is how two of them ended
up identical.

```
NODE_TITLE      semibold, node-title size, bright        identity
PARAM_VALUE     numeric face with tabular figures,       the loudest thing inside
                numeric size, bright
PARAM_UNIT      unit face, unit size, secondary          the value's family, one down
PARAM_LABEL     medium, body size, secondary             subordinate to its value
PORT_LABEL      regular, body size, secondary a shade    the quietest text on the node
                quieter
CONTROL_OPTION  medium, control size, bright             a dropdown's value reads as one
```

Reading order, which is the test: **node name → values → parameter names → port labels.**
Before this, a parameter's name and a port's name were both medium weight, body size,
normal ink — and the value was bright. Four ranks of information, two ranks of type.

### The Amplifier's two `gain`s

Not renamed. The port one is regular weight in the quietest ink on the node, beside its
socket; the parameter one is medium in secondary ink, centred under the knob it names,
with its value bright underneath. They are now different kinds of text saying the same
word, which is what they are.

It is better and it is not finished: the two are still the same size, and what will
actually settle it is position — a port label that reads as belonging to its socket rather
than sitting in the same column of text. That is step 7, and this is the note the brief
asked for rather than a rename.

### The floor bites from above

The first cut of `PARAM_LABEL` dropped it to the secondary size, which is the obvious way
to make a label subordinate. At XL that is 19px against a `MIN_SCREEN_LABEL` floor of 20 —
so at **100% zoom** every parameter name went under the legibility floor, the compensation
system took them over, and the node lost its parameter names and its values at the one
zoom where nothing should be compensated.

Rank is carried by weight and ink here, which the floor has no opinion about. The lesson
generalises: on this editor, type size is load-bearing for the level-of-detail system, and
"make it smaller so it recedes" is not available below the floor.

### Measured

Tabular figures were already in place — `Design.numeric_font` sets `tnum` — so values do
not shove their units sideways as they change; the roles make it explicit rather than
incidental.

Node sizes moved by one to three pixels, from the regular-weight port labels being
narrower than the medium ones they replaced. Topology, positions, ports, cables, control
values, chassis, grid and the other four node types are unchanged, and the detail bands
draw the same 66 / 24 / 0 / 0 controls at the same four zooms.

Precision is untouched: `0.700`, `900.0 Hz`, `0.000 octaves/s` are as they were. Three
decimals on a gain of 0.7 and on a sweep of zero is more precision than either reading
needs, and that is a formatting decision rather than a typographic one — recorded here,
not taken.

## Step 6 — the control as a diagram

The rack's knob is a moulded part: a collar, a cast shadow, a cap, a moulding line, a
sheen, a dark under-stroke beneath the pointer and eleven printed ticks around it. That is
right on a faceplate. In the graph it is nine primitives that say what the knob is made
of, and at 40% they average into a textured grey circle.

`Rack.Knob` gained a `diagram` flag — the same control, same descriptor, same drag, same
keyboard, a different picture, which is the relationship the fader already had with it.
Four marks, and every one says where the knob is set:

```
track     where it can go       one thin arc, quiet
arc       where it is           the same arc in mint, from the minimum
body      the control itself    one disc, one edge
pointer   where it is, again    the strongest mark on it
```

The value is said twice on purpose. The arc reads at a glance and at any size; the pointer
reads precisely. That redundancy is why this survives being shrunk when nine layers of
moulding did not. The pointer is a fifth of the radius and floored at two pixels, where
the rack's was a fixed 2.8 over a dark 4.4 — two smudges once the zoom got hold of it.

### Ticks: compared, then dropped

The proof sheet has three bands — the old knob, the diagram, the diagram with three
reference marks — each at 96px, then at the size a node actually draws it, then that at
66% and 40%, with the knob at 10%, 50% and 90% of its travel.

Three marks are legible on the 96px specimen and gone by 66% of actual size. They are not
carrying position; the arc is. `diagram_ticks` exists and is off, so the comparison can be
made again rather than argued about.

The enlarged specimen does look too simple, which the brief predicted. The actual-size
column is the one that decides, and there the diagram is clearer at every position.

### The dropdown

`mode` was the loudest thing on the Lowpass: a bright slab with a heavy border between two
knobs that had just been quietened. It is the node's own surface now, with the hairline
every other edge here wears and the editor's drawn caret instead of the theme's arrow.

It took two goes, and the first failure is worth keeping: `_mount_chooser` strips every
stylebox off an unpainted module's dropdown as it passes, so the styling was applied and
then quietly removed. The only reason it was caught is that the font size it does *not*
strip stayed put, so the control was half-dressed rather than plainly wrong. The node's
dropdown carries a `node_diagram` mark, and `_mount_chooser` puts the dress back where it
has just taken it off.

### Measured

Node sizes are unchanged from step 5 — the diagram occupies the same box as the moulding
it replaced. Topology, ports, cables, values, typography, grid, chassis, detail bands and
the other four types are all as they were: the same 66 / 24 / 0 / 0 controls at the same
four zooms, the same seven nodes and seven wires.

## Step 7 — ports and cable termination

A cable should look plugged into a socket, not connected to a coloured coordinate.

### The socket

Three marks, and a rule about what each is for:

```
hole    dark, in the canvas's own colour     a socket is a hole in the node
ring    the signal's colour                  what a port must say before it is read
edge    one hairline                         so the ring has an edge against the body
```

No washer, no nut, no bevel, no glow. The knobs have just escaped from miniature hardware
and the ports are not walking back into it.

**The ring carries the type as well as the colour.** Audio is round, control a diamond,
event a square — the same shape language the old grommet drew as a pip *inside* the
socket, moved onto the ring itself. One mark doing two jobs instead of two marks doing one
each, and a reader who cannot separate mint from blue can still separate the ports.

**Connected and unconnected differ in weight, not in light.** An occupied socket has a
fuller ring and a trace of the cable's colour in its hole; an empty one is a thinner ring
around a dark one. The first attempt differed by a shade of alpha and could not be told
apart on the Lowpass, which is the node that has both at once. Nothing glows: whether a
cable is plugged in and whether signal is flowing are two facts, and only one of them is
allowed to be bright.

### Termination

The node draws above the cord layer already, so a cable ends *under* an opaque socket with
no masking, no reordering and no change to the connection coordinate. What had to go was
the plug: `PlugOverlay` draws a mouth and a collar at every connected end, above
everything, and on a node whose port is already a socket that is a second mark saying the
same thing. Ports on the pass are skipped there; the node's own icon is the termination.

### Paint wins where there is paint

The proving ground is now "these three types **and** no faceplate". A painted module keeps
the rack grammar whole — plate, grommet, plug seated in it — because half a module in each
language is worse than either. The panel suite caught exactly that: a painted patch whose
filter had lost its plugs while its neighbours kept theirs. It is a fact about the paint as
much as about the type, so it is decided where the paint is, not where the widget is born.

### Measured

Nothing moved. Same node sizes, same port positions, same seven nodes and seven wires,
same detail bands, same 66 / 24 / 0 / 0 controls. Signal colours untouched; no port
renamed.

The duplicate `gain` reads as two different things now, and it is placement that did it
rather than type: one sits on the perimeter beside a blue diamond, the other under a knob
above its own value. The spatial grammar separates them, which is what step 5 predicted it
would take.

## The acceptance sheet, before step 8

The three specimens together at 100%, 66% and 40%, each captured from the real patch and
composed side by side at one scale per sheet. Five questions, answered honestly:

**Does any node look a generation older than the others?** No. The three share a header,
a socket grammar, a control language and a type ranking, and the four types that have not
been through the pass are visibly of the older generation in the same patch — which is
the evidence the scope is real rather than a claim.

**Can the signal path be followed before reading labels?** Yes, and shape does most of it:
round sockets are audio, diamonds are control, and the cables carry the same colours.

**Do ports dominate?** No, and it is close. At 100% the sockets are the smallest marks on
the node; at 66% they and the header are all that is left, which is the band doing its
job.

**Is the body calm?** Yes at 100%. The Lowpass is the busiest and it is the one with six
ports and four controls.

**At 40%, does the graph become simpler or merely smaller?** Simpler: the controls are
gone, the names are compact where they need to be, and what remains is a labelled box with
sockets.

## Step 8 — width classes, measured rather than chosen

The specimens were measured under the frozen language first, at base scale:

```
node          width  title needs  compact  columns  control room  gutters L/R
Gain           170        96         60       1          84         30 / 23
ADSR           294       136         95       2         184         31 / 23
StateVariable  368        91         64       2         184         74 / 23
```

The classes are those widths rounded up onto the eight the rest of the node is built on:

```
Narrow     176    Gain
Standard   296    ADSR
Wide       376    StateVariableFilter
```

Not equal increments, and there is no reason they should be — a class exists to give the
graph a rhythm of a few repeated widths, not to make a table of round numbers. There is no
fourth class yet; one arrives when a node earns it, measured the same way.

`NodeGrid.WIDTH_CLASS` maps type to class. That is metadata: a width that emerges from
whatever minimum sizes the controls happened to ask for is not a class, it is an accident
with a name.

### What changed

```
Amplifier      230 -> 238    (+8)
Amp Envelope   397 -> 400    (+3)
Lowpass        497 -> 508    (+11)
```

Titles are unchanged at 100, 66, 40 and 28% — canonical where they were canonical, compact
where they were compact. No other node moved; topology, ports, cables and values are as
they were.

### The long-label ceiling

`PORT_GUTTER_MAX` is 96 at base scale. The longest gutter in the proving ground is the
Lowpass's 74, so it does not bind today; it is there so that the first node with a
genuinely long port name clips and records the overflow on itself rather than dragging the
width system wider. What to do about such a label — a compact port name, a second line, a
tooltip — is its own policy, and this is the ceiling that stops it being decided by
accident.

## Step 9 — the identity glyph

### On the Noun Project

The client is `TheMutantFactory/noun-project-utils` — a standard-library Python CLI for
API v2, whose credentials resolve from `NOUN_KEY`/`NOUN_SECRET`, then
`~/.config/noun/credentials.cfg`, then the Dot-Gobbler game's own Godot store. It was
already on this machine and already authenticated, which the first pass of this step
failed to find and wrongly reported as "no integration anywhere". The search below is what
that pass should have contained.

**It cost nothing.** `search` and `usage` are free; only `GET /v2/icon/{id}` is metered.
The metered counter read 2 before this step and 2 after; the free counter went 9 to 24.
And search results carry `thumbnail_url` on the static CDN, so every candidate below was
**looked at**, as a contact sheet of PNGs, without a download being charged. That is the
useful discovery for the rollout: the whole browsing half of this work is free, and the
spend only begins if a mark is actually taken.

### What the corpus said about the three concepts

```
concept    searched                                   read
amplifier  "amplifier", "operational amplifier",      1013490, 5944775, 6311101,
           "gain"                                     1375352/3, 8455775, 8372410
filter     "low pass filter", "audio filter",         4799932, 4799936, 4799937,
           "frequency response", "filter cutoff"      6041992, 627910, 5341173
envelope   "adsr envelope"                            6850395, 385861-385867
```

**Nothing was redrawn.** All three marks are the convention the corpus converges on, which
is the outcome to want from a search like this — it is evidence the marks are readable by
people who have never seen this program, not a shopping trip.

- **The amplifier.** Every serious result is the schematic triangle. `1013490` is the
  cleanest of them and is the same drawing as ours. What the corpus adds is a
  *subtraction*: they nearly all carry `+`/`−` input pins and power rails, and ours must
  not. Those pins make it an op-amp, and a Gain node is a gain stage, not a part.
- **"gain" is a financial word.** `8372410`, `8228118`, `7593916`, `6775810` are all
  arrows, bar charts and dollar coins. Worth knowing beyond this step: it is a term the
  browser's search should not lean on either.
- **The response curve.** `4799932` (`lpf`, Slamet Widodo, from a collection called
  Signal Processors, 158763) is our mark almost exactly — flat, a knee, away down the top
  end. Two things come with it. Its siblings `4799936` (`hpf`) and `4799937` (`bpf`) are
  the same drawing mirrored and humped, so **the filter family already has a drawing rule**
  waiting for the day HighPass and BandPass need marks. And it draws axes, which ours does
  not; at an 18-pixel header those lines would be a pixel of clutter, so the omission
  stands, but it is now a decision rather than an oversight.
- **The two rejected metaphors are both in the corpus, and both are worse.** `627910` is
  the funnel — a picture of a filter — and `6041992` is a literal resistor and capacitor.
  Step 9 turned both down on reasoning; the sheet is what that reasoning looks like at
  150 pixels.
- **The envelope.** `6850395` is the four-stage contour, same as ours. The better find is
  `385861`-`385867`: one family that draws the *whole* envelope every time and solids only
  the segment being named, dashing the rest. That is a real technique for showing which
  stage is running, and it is written down here because interaction states are step 11's
  problem and this is the answer arriving early.

### What is owed

Nothing. No artwork was downloaded and none is used: these are conventions read off a
corpus, and a schematic amplifier triangle is not anybody's copyright. So there is no
attribution string to ship and the marks remain locally drawn.

If a glyph is ever genuinely sourced, `TheMutantFactory/get-in-loser` is the layout to
copy — the downloaded original kept so derived files can be rebuilt, a licence record with
creator and terms, a generator, and the attribution in prose with the modifications named.
It also names the thing SoundGraph would need and does not have: CC BY wants *visible*
attribution, so a sourced icon means the application needs somewhere to show it, and that
somewhere is Help.

### The marks

```
Gain                  the amplifier symbol: a triangle in the signal path
StateVariableFilter   the response: flat, a knee, away down the top end
ADSR                  the envelope's own polyline, attack through release
```

All three describe behaviour rather than equipment — a response curve rather than a
filter, the amplifier symbol rather than an amplifier. A picture of the hardware would be
the third time this pass has had to walk back out of a rack.

**Gain was a comparison.** The other candidate was amplitude growing along a signal: a
horizontal line with a short upright at one end and a tall one at the other. At header
size the two uprights and the line read as a plus sign. The triangle is what a gain stage
is called on every schematic ever printed and it survives the size, so the level candidate
was drawn, rejected and deleted rather than kept as a second option nobody would choose.

**The envelope reuses the browser rail's mark**, which is the same idea in a different
place — one icon set, used twice. The filter does not: the rail's Filters row is a funnel,
which names the *category*, and the node names the *operation*. Two marks for related
things, and it is deliberate; recorded here because it is the sort of thing that looks
like an oversight later.

### Where it sits

At the left of the title, in a cell that is reserved whether or not a type has a glyph
yet, so rolling the rest of the library through the pass cannot make titles jitter
sideways. Identity ink, not a signal colour: a lowpass is not green because audio is
green. Title stronger than mark, mark stronger than metadata — the ranking the menu's
doors already use.

### The mark stands down when the title is compensated

At 66% and below the node's own title Label is hidden and the name is drawn at the
legibility floor from the node's left edge. A mark left in place there has two ways to go
and both are wrong: over the letters, or in front of them — taking room the name needs and
pushing it into its compact form earlier than it should, which is a threshold moved by a
decoration. So the glyph fades with the Label it belongs to. The identity glyph is a
full-size device; below that, the name is the identity.

That is the honest limitation of this step: **the accelerator is not there in the band
where reading is hardest.** Making it survive means revisiting how the compensated title
divides the header, which is step 12's question and not this one's.

### Measured

Node sizes byte-identical to step 8. Titles identical at 100, 66, 40 and 28% — canonical
and compact exactly where they were. No node widened, no threshold moved, no control,
port, dropdown or header dimension touched.

Blind test: with the titles hidden, the three headers read as an amplifier, a time
contour and a frequency response. The envelope and the response curve are the closest pair
— both are angular lines — and they still separate: one rises before it falls and holds a
plateau, the other starts flat and only falls.

## Step 10 — the family grammar

Not forty icons. The three marks that worked, turned into the rules they obey, and two
families drawn to prove the rules produce siblings rather than one-off pictures.

`editor-godot/glyph_grammar.gd` holds the contract and the family plans;
`editor-godot/glyph_sheet.gd` renders the proof. The reasoning, the sheet's row order and
the two places the grammar strains are in `docs/node-glyph-grammar.md`; when to search the
Noun Project and what it costs is in `docs/icon-sourcing.md`.

Three things worth carrying out of it:

**The specimens are unchanged, and that is measured.** The lowpass was rewritten to be
constructed from the shared grammar rather than from its own hand-placed numbers, and all
twelve renders — three marks, four sizes — come out pixel for pixel identical to the
capture taken before the change. A refactor that claims to change nothing should be made
to prove it.

**The proof sheet found a rule.** Siblings have to differ in silhouette, not in a detail.
Mirroring is a silhouette and the highpass is immediately the lowpass; removing one stroke
is not, and the routing switch is legible only if you already suspect it. Three
constructions were drawn for the switch and the best of them still fails, which is
recorded as a failure rather than nudged until it photographs well.

**Nothing was migrated.** Gain, StateVariableFilter and ADSR are still the only types
wearing a mark. The seven new glyphs are attached to nothing.

`design_test.gd` now checks every icon marks pixels and stays inside its cell — the first
because an icon that silently draws nothing is the tofu box in a new hat, the second
because the field is what keeps a mark off the title beside it.

## Step 11 — the state vocabulary

Five channels, one per fact, so that a node can be selected, broken and passing signal at
once and a reader can still answer each separately. `editor-godot/node_state.gd` holds
them; `editor-godot/state_sheet.gd` proves them on First Synth; `docs/node-states.md` is
the record, the measurements and the two verdicts.

The short version:

**Selection** is a continuous mint perimeter at twice the weight, calmed a fifth of the
way toward the node surface. Two cues, one of them not colour, and continuity is what
separates it from the mint already inside the node.

**Validity** is the header, tinted 16% toward amber or red, with a bang at the far end.
Sixteen is not a preference: at 18 the title of a selected broken node falls to 6.95:1,
under the program's own 7:1 floor, and `design_test.gd` now checks every combination in
every palette so it cannot drift back. The old treatment washed the whole node in red
with `modulate`, which recoloured its sockets and the cable ends on them — the signal
vocabulary spent on an unrelated fact.

**Hover** is six tenths of a surface step, and it was a third until the proof sheet showed
two specimens nobody could tell apart at 1.08 times the plain header.

**Activity** stays local. The rule the step settled on is that node-level activity is only
worth drawing when the activity has structure beyond "signal exists" — so Gain and
StateVariableFilter get nothing, and the sheet's active row shows a lit socket on an
otherwise ordinary node, which is the finding rather than a gap in it.

**The ADSR stage prototype works and is not switched on.** The whole contour stays drawn
and the live segment is picked out; identity survives, which was the hard requirement.
Left against right reads at header size and the two middle segments do not, so what it
honestly says is "an envelope is running, roughly here" rather than which stage. Nothing
in the editor sets a stage — that would have to come from dsp-core — so the mechanism
exists, is measured, and waits for a data source.

Selection, validity and activity all survive 40%. The bang and the identity glyph do not,
and nothing was added to keep them.

## Step 12 — the optical contract

Most of the machinery was already right. `NodeOptical` names what it does — FULL,
REDUCED, MAP, on the four bands that already produced them, with no new thresholds — and
`optical_sheet.gd` audits it by sweeping every boundary at a hundredth and a
half-hundredth either side rather than photographing four zooms. `docs/node-optical-
states.md` is the record.

Two bugs fixed, one table corrected, one disagreement resolved in the renderer's favour.

**The ellipsis was cutting the wrong name.** Below 0.28 the Amp Envelope fell to
`Amp E…`: the fallback found the type's compact name, decided `Envelope` did not fit
either, and then cut the *canonical* name — discarding the shorter name it had just
rejected in order to cut the longer one. The rule now is canonical, then compact, then
nothing at all, which is this pass's own governing rule applied to its last case. An
ellipsis in the graph now means exactly one thing: that type has not been through the
pass. `design_test.gd` holds the migrated three at zero cuts across thirty-six zooms and
five palettes.

**The identity glyph is not on the band ladder.** It stands down with the title at the
title's own compensation boundary, near 0.90 at XL — inside FULL, above the FULL/REDUCED
line at 0.875 — so the bottom slice of FULL has no mark. The behaviour is right and the
first draft of the survival table was wrong, so the table changed and the code did not.

**REDUCED keeps parameter names and drops their values**, which is the opposite of the
brief's priority and is correct: a name with no number still says what the node has and a
number with no name says nothing. At XL and 0.83 a cell is 94 screen pixels and
"resonance" wants 85 at the legibility floor, so it is one word or none.

**REDUCED is a tenth of a zoom wide at XL and three tenths at Comfortable.** The FULL
floor is computed from base type sizes and so does not move with the interface scale,
while the room floors under it do. Reported and not changed — a corrected FULL floor would
sit below the REDUCED floor at XL and delete the band, and which of the two governs is a
real question rather than an arithmetic slip.

Empty MAP bodies were audited and left alone. The footprint a node keeps at every zoom is
what makes the map correspond to the thing it is a map of.

## Step 13 — how a value is written

`0.700` is a debugger printing a float; `0.7` is an instrument telling you its setting.
`editor-godot/value_text.gd` is the one formatter, and both the graph and the rack call
it — there used to be two identical copies drifting apart. `docs/value-text.md` is the
record.

The old rule keyed the decimals to the value's own magnitude, which is why every value on
a normalised control wore three of them whatever the control was. The new one asks the
parameter descriptor: enough decimals for about five hundred readings across the range,
never fewer than three significant figures, then the trailing zeros come off. A gain of 0
to 4 gets thousandths and a cutoff of 20 to 20000 hertz gets whole hertz, from one rule.

```
gain 0.700 -> 0.7        cutoff 900.0 Hz -> 900 Hz      resonance 0.550 -> 0.55
sweep 0.000 octaves/s -> 0 octaves/s     attack 10.0 ms -> 10 ms
decay 250.0 ms -> 250 ms                 release 300.0 ms -> 300 ms
```

No node changed size — 238x150, 508x248 and 400x101 before and after.

**The parse was broken and this step fixed it.** A field showing `10.0 ms` seeded its
editor with that string, and pressing return without changing a character stored **ten
seconds**: the display converted units and the parse did not, so the one gesture that
should be a no-op moved the value furthest. It predates this step; the old formatting made
it harder to notice.

Where no unit is typed the two conversions want opposite answers — 20 over a millisecond
reading means milliseconds, 440 over a kilohertz reading means hertz — and what separates
them is the parameter's own range rather than a guess. The property the suite holds is a
fixed point rather than equality: what the field shows, parsed and shown again, is the
same string. A display is a rounding and always was.

## Step 14 — First Synth, all seven

The four that were left — Main Oscillator, Filter Sweep, Keyboard and Output — take the
frozen steps 3–13 language. `NodeIdentity.MIGRATED` is seven types now, which is every
node in the patch, and the graph can finally be judged as a composition rather than as
three islands inside the old interface.

**Nothing new was designed.** Two glyphs came straight out of the family grammar, one out
of the seam idea, and the fourth was abandoned after three attempts.

### Widths: all four fitted classes that already existed

```
type                  natural   class      as drawn
SawOscillator           253     Standard      400
seam:Output/stereo      286     Standard      401
LFO                     326     Wide          508
seam:Input/note         350     Wide          508
```

Natural is base scale under the frozen anatomy, drawn is at XL. Three at Narrow/Standard
/Wide already existed and no fifth was needed, which is the first real evidence that three
is enough — a class system whose first four arrivals each want a new class is not one.

The cost is visible and worth naming: the Keyboard's content wants 350 and its class gives
it 376, so it carries the widest empty margin in the patch. That is what a class system
buys a rhythm with. The Output stands one pixel over its class at 401, because the class
is a floor rather than a cap and its content asks for that pixel.

### The saw and the sweep

The pair the step was really about. They come apart without either wearing a
distinguishing decoration, because the family grammar already had the answer: a generator
is drawn as **the waveform it makes**, so a `SawOscillator` is a sawtooth, and a modulator
is drawn as **the shape of a value over time**, so an LFO is one large smooth cycle.
Angular against smooth — a silhouette rather than a detail, which is rule 9.

The Noun Project agrees and was asked for free: every icon filed under `sawtooth` is a
ramp and every one under `modulation` is a sinuous curve. Nothing was downloaded.

### The keyboard that could not be drawn

Three cuts were drawn — a full case with black keys hanging into it, an open pair of rails,
and keys standing on a front rail with no case. All three fill in at header size, and the
reason is structural rather than fixable: a keyboard's identity is *many parallel
elements* and the glyph field is about seven stroke widths across. You cannot draw many
parallel things in seven stroke widths.

So the seams are drawn as what they are — the edge of the patch — rather than as the
equipment on the other side of it. A bar for the boundary and a line for the signal
crossing it, mirrored for direction: `⊢` entering, `⊣` leaving. One drawing, two members,
told apart by a mirror, which is the same rule that gave the highpass and the merge. What
kind of signal crosses is said by the socket's own colour and shape, a channel that
already exists and does not need saying twice.

### One key, asked the same way everywhere

The migration turned up a real bug and it took three edits to finish. A seam is keyed by
the port it stands for — `seam:Input/note` — and the patch document's own `type` field
says only `Input`. `_type_key()` has always existed to reconcile them, and three places
were not using it: the width class, the diagram-control switch, and the parameter row's.

The symptoms were exactly what you would expect from two keys for one thing. The seams
took the new anatomy from `_style_widget` (which uses the key) and missed their width
class (which did not). The Output's safety-limit dropdown came out with a native chevron
and rounded corners next to a Filter Sweep whose dropdown was flat and square, and its
level knob kept the rack's tick ring while every other migrated knob had shed it.

### The gate

Seven nodes, seven wires, every port count and every position identical to the step 1
baseline. Zero elided titles across thirty-three zooms — the whole patch reads as whole
words at 28%, where two of the four used to be cut.

Four suite checks were rewritten rather than deleted. They asserted the old unmigrated
hover mechanism — "a node at rest has no stylebox override" — on `osc`, which is now
migrated and therefore always carries its anatomy. They ask `NodeState` now, which is what
the fact actually is.

### The 401, and what a width class actually is

Neither of the two candidate explanations. The class *was* authoritative — the Output
seam's own combined minimum agreed with its class at every moment — and the node stood at
401 anyway, because a `custom_minimum_size` only ever pushes a Control wider and nothing
pulls one back down. A child asked for one extra pixel while the rows were being built,
the node grew, the child settled, and the pixel stayed. A high-water mark, not a
disagreement.

So the width is now **set as well as floored**, in the same post-layout pass that already
measures node heights for the same reason. And two things are written down in
`node_grid.gd` that were not:

**What the figure measures.** The outer footprint in graph space at base scale — the whole
box a reader sees and a cable lands on, border and content margins included, before
`Design.scale()` multiplies it.

**A class is decided at a type's worst interface scale.** This one the gate found. Chasing
the 401 turned up that the Output seam fits Standard at XL and does not at Comfortable:
the class figure scales linearly and the content does not, because type sizes stop
shrinking at `TYPE_FLOOR`, so at smaller scales the words inside a node are relatively
larger than the box around them. XL — the scale every acceptance in this pass has been
judged at — is the *most forgiving* one, which is worth knowing before fifty types are
assigned by looking at it.

The Output seam is therefore Wide, not Standard. And the other thing that finding says:
**Standard has almost no headroom.** It was derived from one specimen, the ADSR at 294,
and rounded to 296; the very next type to arrive wanted 299. A batch that puts several
types between 296 and 330 is evidence to re-derive the class rather than to keep sending
them all to Wide.

`editor_test.gd` now holds every migrated node at exactly its declared class, and reports
the overflow when one will not fit — which is a design question raised rather than
absorbed.

## Step 14B — the first family batch, and two exceptions

Three types adopted the language and needed nothing new. Three more were held, and the
batch as named could not be run at all. Both of those are reported here rather than worked
around, which is what the batch was for.

### Exception 1 — Highpass, Bandpass and Notch are not node types

They are `mode` values. `StateVariableFilter` has four — lowpass, highpass, bandpass,
notch — and `OnePoleFilter` has two. There is no type to migrate and no type to hang a
glyph on, so the three response curves step 10 drew and proved have nothing to attach to
under the current rule, which keys a glyph to a type.

That also means there is a **live defect**, introduced in step 9 and invisible until now:
a StateVariableFilter set to notch wears a lowpass mark. First Synth's filter happens to
be in lowpass mode, which is why nobody saw it, and a mark that says the wrong thing is
worse than no mark at all.

The fix is a rule the grammar does not currently have — **a glyph keyed by a type and a
mode, for a type that declares one** — and a new rule is a design decision rather than
something a migration gets to make. It is small, it would put the four drawings to work,
and it would make the filter's header say what the filter is actually doing. Not taken
here.

### Exception 2 — the batch asked for a fourth width class

Measured at Comfortable, which the step 14A finding established as the binding scale:

```
Noise                 290     Standard      migrated
Phaser                326     Wide          migrated
NoiseOscillator       354     Wide          migrated
OnePoleFilter         405     -- no class holds it
SquareOscillator      410     -- no class holds it
SineOscillator        413     -- no class holds it
```

Three independent types inside eight units of each other, all just past Wide at 376. That
is a cluster earning a class rather than one node being awkward, and rounded onto the
eight the figure would be **416**. It is not added, and the three types are held out of
`MIGRATED` until the decision is taken.

### What went in

Noise, NoiseOscillator and Phaser, on the mechanical checklist and with no new ideas. All
three stand at exactly their declared class at both interface scales, zero elided titles,
topology and values untouched.

Two things worth noting from them. Both noise sources wear the same mark, because they are
the same operation and the word beside it says which — the same reasoning the browser's
three banks share one. And **the Phaser ships with no glyph at all**: its family, things
that happen over time, has not been drawn, the identity cell is reserved whether or not a
type has a mark, and the title still starts where every other title starts. It is the
first type to ship on "no glyph beats a misleading glyph", and it costs nothing.

### The generator family needed one rule, and it was earned

A sine oscillator and an LFO are both a sine. The grammar had no way to tell them apart
until this batch, and the answer is not a badge: **a generator's waveform repeats and a
control's does not.** Two cycles against one. The shape's own frequency is the silhouette,
which is rule 9, and it is also simply true — an oscillator runs at audio rate and an LFO
does not.

Noise took a second attempt. Drawn as a polyline of unequal heights it is a zigzag, and at
header size a zigzag is the sine's ripple; the two were indistinguishable on the proof
sheet. Drawn as unequal bars standing off a centre line it says the thing that actually
separates noise from every other waveform — that no two excursions are alike and none
follows from the last — and it is unlike anything else in the set at every size.

## Step 14B.1 — identity variants, and a fourth width class

### The header does not hard-code Lowpass

Checked before writing any code, because if it did, fixing only the glyph would have left
a second lie. It does not. The registry already calls the type **Filter**
(`kStateVariableFilter`'s display name), which is option A and was in force all along;
`Lowpass` is the name the First Synth example's author gave that instance, the same way
the oscillator in it is called `Main Oscillator`.

So nothing about the identity needed changing. What did need changing is that the mark
ignored the mode.

### One declared parameter may drive identity

`NodeIdentity.VARIANT`. A type may declare **one** discrete parameter whose values change
the operation it performs, and choose a mark for each:

```
StateVariableFilter   mode   lowpass / highpass / bandpass / notch
OnePoleFilter         mode   lowpass / highpass
```

Everything else stays keyed by type alone. The narrowness is the point — the general rule
"a glyph may depend on a parameter" would let any moving value drive identity, and
identity would stop being identity. Rule 7a in `glyph_grammar.gd`, and `design_test.gd`
checks the mechanism has not spread: every declared type names its parameter, has marks
for more than one mode, draws a different mark for each, and falls back to its type mark
for a mode it has not got.

**The name never varies.** A node keeps what its author called it while the glyph says
which response is running and the dropdown says it in words. A node that renamed itself
when you turned one control would look like it had become a different type, which it has
not. That does mean First Synth's filter, called `Lowpass` by its author, will wear a
notch curve if somebody sets it to notch — which is what every author-given name in the
program does when the thing under it changes, and is theirs to update.

Step 10's four response curves are finally doing something.

### Width.EXTRA, at 416

Added on the evidence rather than in advance: three independent types — OnePoleFilter at
405, SquareOscillator at 410, SineOscillator at 413, all measured at Comfortable — inside
eight units of each other and all just past Wide at 376. Rounded onto the eight, 416.

Named plainly, because the useful thing is the metric and the assignment rather than a
taxonomy. And it establishes how the class set grows from here:

> Classes are discovered from clusters of actual requirement across the corpus, not chosen
> in advance and not stretched to fit one awkward node.

Sending three types to a class 130 units wider than they need, to preserve a set inferred
from three initial specimens, would have been the tail wagging the dog.

No types were migrated into it in this commit. The three that earned it are still held out
of `MIGRATED`, and they are the front of the 14C queue.

### One more rule out of the batch

Rule 9a: **repetition count is silhouette.** How many times a shape repeats inside the
field is part of its outline rather than a detail on it — two cycles of a sine and one
cycle of a sine are told apart instantly and neither is wearing a badge. It should
generalise to the temporal family, where a clock, a pulse train and a delay are the same
idea at different densities.

## Step 14C — the control family

Seven types in, one held, one new gate, and one thing to decide.

### The temporal family

Everything in it is a value over time, which is also what the envelope and the modulation
wave already were. What separates the members is **density and regularity**:

```
repeated smooth cycles     a generator, at audio rate
one broad cycle            a modulator, under it
repeated equal pulses      a clock: regular, discrete, and it only says when
unequal bars               noise: no two alike and none following from the last
a joined staircase         sample and hold: a continuous signal held between samples
separated blocks           a sequencer: a list of discrete values, not a signal
one diagonal               a slide: the whole mark is the transition
one flat line              a constant: the value that does not change
```

Two devices do the work and both are honest. **Regular against irregular** tells a clock
from noise and a sequencer from a sample-and-hold. **Joined against separated** tells a
held signal from a list of values, which is exactly the difference between them.

The clock needed an optical cut. At sixteen hundredths of a reach a pulse is two pixels
wide — the stroke weight — so its two edges and its top filled into a block, and three
blocks on a line read as a square wave. At header size a pulse is one upright standing on
the baseline instead, and the baseline is what keeps it apart from every other rectangular
mark in the set.

### The variant mechanism carried to a second type

`OnePoleFilter` uses the same four-curve filter family as `StateVariableFilter`, with two
of them. Type implementation and filter mode stay separate facts: what a one-pole filter
is, is a filter; which response it is running is the curve on its header.

### Widths: the 416 class was the right rung

Measured at Comfortable, which is the binding scale:

```
Constant          163    Narrow
SampleHold        194    Standard
StepSequencer     354    Wide
Clock             388    Extra
OnePoleFilter     405    Extra
SquareOscillator  410    Extra
SineOscillator    413    Extra
Slide             433    -- held, 17 past the top of the set
```

Four of seven landed in the class the previous batch's evidence created, which is the
first sign it was a real rung rather than an accommodation. **Slide is held**: one type 17
units past Extra is an outlier, not a cluster, and the rule wants several independent
types agreeing before a rung is added. Its glyph is drawn and waiting.

A measurement note that cost an hour: a node built while the graph is already at a reduced
zoom never reaches its full width, because its rows are hidden from the start and the size
high-water mark is the reduced one. The first run of this batch reported a one-pole filter
at 194 when it stands at 405 everywhere a person would see it. **Widths are measured at
zoom 1.0, at full detail, or they are not measured.**

### The gate found nine missing compact names

`editor_test.gd` now sweeps **every migrated type**, not the ones that happen to be in the
example patch — the rollout adds types faster than any one patch can hold them. It uses
the registry's display name and the type's own width class, and it immediately failed on
nine of seventeen.

The batches before this one had assigned compact names by eye, judging at 28% and stopping
there. A compact name is not a judgement about whether the canonical will fit; it is what
a type is called when there is no room, and a type without one falls back to cutting.

It does not have to fit either, which is the part that makes this tractable. A Narrow node
at a quarter zoom has room for about three characters and no real word is three
characters, so a compact name will sometimes not fit and the renderer draws nothing at
all. That is the step 12 rule working — remove information rather than reduce its
legibility — and `Co…` is not an identity.

```

seam:Output/stereo Output       SquareOscillator   Square

```

### One decision, not taken

`SawOscillator`'s compact name is `Oscillator`, agreed in 14A when it was the only
oscillator in the language. There are three now, and `Oscillator` for the saw one is the
odd entry in a set that otherwise reads `Sine`, `Square`, `Saw`. At map size First Synth
says `Oscillator` where a sine oscillator beside it would say `Sine`.

Changing it is one line and it changes what an approved picture says, so it is reported
rather than done.

## Step 14C.1 — the migration contract, and an unresolved measurement

Housekeeping, plus one thing the housekeeping turned up that is not resolved.

### Saw, not Oscillator

`SawOscillator`'s compact name was chosen when it was the only oscillator in the language.
There are three now, and `Oscillator` had become the odd member of a set that otherwise
reads `Sine`, `Square`, `Saw` — at map size First Synth said "Oscillator" where a sine
beside it would have said "Sine".

### A compact name is part of the contract

Every migrated type declares one, including the three whose canonical name already fits
anywhere. `Noise`, `Phaser` and `Clock` say their two names are the same, on purpose,
rather than by omission. `design_test.gd` holds the whole of `MIGRATED` to it.

The reasoning is the rule that everything else rests on: an ellipsis in the graph means
exactly one thing, a type that has not been through the pass, and that only stays true if
every type that *has* been through it can fall back to a written-down name instead of a
cut. Whether the compact name fits at some particular zoom is a separate question, and the
answer when it does not is silence.

### The width harness

`editor-godot/width_sheet.gd`. Hand it types, or nothing to re-measure everything already
migrated, and it reports what each one's contents want at every interface scale with the
smallest class that holds the worst of them.

Two rules are enforced in the code rather than remembered:

**A specimen is measured at zoom 1.0 in FULL detail.** A node built while the graph is
already reduced never reaches its full width — its rows are hidden from the start and a
minimum only pushes a Control wider. A node constructed directly in REDUCED or MAP is not
a valid width specimen.

**And with the classes suppressed.** `NodeGrid.measuring` exists for this and nothing else.
A classed node cannot be measured, because its width is pinned to its class and reading it
back reports the class; and the other obvious reading — emptying the minimum and asking
for the combined minimum — measures how far the contents can be *squeezed*, which is a
different and useless number.

### The open question

The harness says several migrated types want more room than their class gives them at the
smaller interface scales, and that `StateVariableFilter` wants 411 at Comfortable against
a Wide class of 376. It says the same headless and windowed.

`editor_test.gd`, measuring the live First Synth patch at the same scale and the same
zoom, says that node stands at 376.

**These disagree and I do not know why.** The obvious candidates have been eliminated: it
is not headless against windowed, not the alert mark a scratch patch's unconnected inputs
add, not the difference between a lone node and a patch, and not too few frames after the
zoom change. It is reported here rather than acted on, because the conclusion it points at
— that the class table was derived at XL and XL is the most forgiving scale — would mean
re-deriving every class, and that is not a thing to do on a measurement two instruments
disagree about.

The suite's check was corrected in the meantime and is honest about its reach: it measures
at zoom 1.0 rather than in whatever reduced state the patch opened in, which is the same
trap in a smaller costume, and it asserts the floor — a migrated node is never *narrower*
than its class — while printing any overflow with its figure. It reports none today.

## Step 14C.2 — what a width class actually claims

The `411 preferred / 376 live` disagreement is resolved, and the resolution is that
**both numbers were wrong as class selectors.**

They were answers to different questions. 411 is how wide the node makes itself when
nothing constrains it — a container asking for its most comfortable arrangement. 376 is
"Godot did not push it back out", which is not the same as being laid out correctly. The
question a width class actually asks is neither:

> What is the narrowest class at which this node is still **valid** in FULL detail, at its
> worst interface scale?

`width_sheet.gd` answers it by forcing a node to each class in turn and asking whether
anything broke: a refused width, a label given less room than it asked for, a child
reaching outside its node, two controls overlapping on a row, a body that reflowed and
grew taller. The first class that survives is the class. Preferred width is still
reported, as diagnosis.

For the state-variable filter the answer is **416** — neither 411 nor 376. It is Extra now,
not Wide, and it was assigned from an XL measurement where it stands at 368.

### Two bugs the validator found on the way

**A width class was shrinking below base scale.** At Compact the interface factor is 0.875,
so a Wide node was handed 329 real pixels instead of 376 — while the text inside it barely
shrank at all, because `Design.type` floors every size at `TYPE_FLOOR`. The words were
relatively *larger* than the box around them. Five types fitted no class at all at Compact
and fitted perfectly at every other scale, which is not five awkward types; it is a box
being shrunk out from under its contents.

Classes now scale up and never down, which is the rule `Design.screen_minimum` has always
used and for the same reason. A reader who asks for smaller interface text is not asking
for narrower nodes.

**And then the spacing disagreed with the widths.** `_graph_scale` was still shrinking
document positions at Compact while node widths had stopped, so First Synth's nodes
overlapped — `layout_test` caught it immediately. Spacing and the things it spaces are one
system or they are a bug waiting for somebody to change their interface size. Both use the
same rule now.

### Where it stands

Fifteen migrated types, four interface scales, every one of them assigned to the smallest
class it is valid at, and every declared class correct. `editor_test` agrees at its own
scale and reports no node standing over its class.

One number moved in the process: the filter is 40 base units wider than it was, which is
what a class being wrong looks like when it is corrected.

## Step 14D — where signals meet

The batch as named could not be run, for the same reason 14B's could not, and the reason
is worth stating plainly.

### There are no routing node types

No Split, no Merge, no Crossfade, no Selector, no Switch. **Splitting is a cable
operation** in SoundGraph — one output takes as many connections as you draw — and merging
is what a Mixer or an Add does. There is no Routing category in the registry at all; the
combining nodes are filed under Amplitude and Maths.

So step 10's routing family is in the position the filter siblings were in before the
variant mechanism: drawn, proved, and with nothing to attach to. `ROUTE_MERGE` finally has
a type in the Mixer. `ROUTE_SPLIT` and `ROUTE_SWITCH` still do not, and the switch that
failed rule 9 has no migration batch to arrive in.

That also answers the question this batch was set: **Mixer against Merge is not a
collision, because Merge is not a node.** The real version of it is Mixer against Add —
both many-to-one — and they do not collide at all, because they are in different families.
A mixer is topology and draws cords converging on a terminal; an add is an operator and
draws the summing junction. Nothing about those two silhouettes is close.

### The combining family

Two marks, and they were a family before anybody here drew them: **a ring with a cross in
it is a multiplier and a ring with a plus in it is a summing junction**, which is how block
diagrams have said it for as long as there have been block diagrams. One ring, two
contents, and nothing else in the set is a ring with something inside it.

They were drawn with the ring dropped at header size — six pixels of circle around a
three-pixel cross looked like it would be a smudge. The proof sheet said otherwise, in the
most direct way available: **a bare cross at twenty-four pixels is the dismiss button,
stroke for stroke.** A node wearing a close control is a node somebody will try to close.
So the ring is drawn at every size and the mark inside it shrinks instead — the ring is
the part that says diagram rather than interface, which makes it the part that cannot go.

### What went in

```
type          class      mark
Mixer         Standard   cords converging on one terminal
Add           Narrow     the summing junction
Multiply      Narrow     the same ring, crossed
Level         Narrow     the amplifier triangle
StereoLevel   Standard   the same
```

Level and its stereo twin wear the gain stage's mark because that is what they are — the
same reasoning that gives both noise sources one mark, with the word beside it saying
which. All five fitted classes that already existed, by the forced-width validator at
every interface scale.

Twenty migrated types now, and the validator reports every one of them standing at the
smallest class it is valid at.

## Step 14E — time, and response shapes

Four types, and the interesting thing is that they did not form a family. The registry
files Delay, Comb and Allpass under Time and Formant under Filters; the marks went the
other way, because **family membership follows what a mark means and not what the registry
filed it under.**

```
Delay      temporal repetition      the clock's uprights, decaying
Comb       a response shape         the notch, repeated
Formant    a response shape         the bandpass peak, repeated
Allpass    nothing yet              the cell is reserved
```

No effects family was manufactured. There is no wavy line that means "this is an effect",
and there should not be.

### The comb and the formant are rule 9a again

Neither is new. A comb filter puts periodic notches in a spectrum and a formant filter
puts two or three resonances in it, so both are the response grammar with **repetition
count as silhouette**: one dip is a notch and three dips are a comb, one peak is a
bandpass and three peaks are a formant.

They are also each other's inverse, the way the notch and the bandpass already were —
dips in a line that is otherwise passing, against peaks rising out of a line that is
otherwise not. That is the same pair of shapes the family already trades in, which is what
a family is for.

Drawn directly rather than through the response plan, because the knee rule is about a
single transition between two bands and these are a row of narrow features. A shoulder on
each side of three dips inside fifteen pixels is a solid bar.

### The delay is the clock, decaying

Deliberately close to it and deliberately not it. Both are uprights on a baseline, because
both are events in time. What separates them is that a clock's are all one height and a
delay's fall away — **regular means generated, decaying means repeated**, and that is
exactly the difference between the two nodes.

The collision sheet carries the pairs the batch was most likely to fail on, and none of
them do: delay against clock and against sample-and-hold, comb against square and against
the sequencer, formant against the single bandpass peak.

### The allpass has no mark, and the corpus agrees

Its magnitude response is flat, which `Constant` already owns. Its phase response falls
monotonically, which is the lowpass. And the Noun Project has **no signal-domain metaphor
for phase at all** — "phase shift" returns project milestones and rounded chevrons,
"Phaser" returns a ray gun. Searched free, nothing downloaded.

So the cell is reserved, as the Phaser's is, and the two of them are consistent because
they are the same unsolved problem: phase behaviour has no picture yet. An arbitrary swirl
would be a decoration pretending to be an identity.

### Widths

Allpass and Formant to Standard, Delay and Comb to Wide, all by the forced-width validator
at every interface scale. Nothing needed a class that did not exist.

Twenty-four migrated types.

## Step 14F — maths, and where the visual space ran out

Four types migrated, **one glyph shipped, three cells reserved.** The three that failed are
the most useful thing this batch produced.

### There was no ring family to extend

`Add` and `Multiply` established that a symbol inside a ring is a mathematical operator.
There is no Subtract, no Divide, no Negate and no Modulo in the registry, so there were no
siblings to give it. The family is two marks and that is all there is to be consistent
with.

### Compare is a threshold, not a comparator

Worth checking before drawing anything: `Compare` has no mode parameter. It emits 1 while
a is at or above b and 0 below — **a signal turned into a gate**. So it is not a
`<`/`>`/`=` selector and never needed the identity-variant mechanism, and its mark is not
notation at all: a level running the width of the field with the signal climbing through
it. Everything above the line is a one and everything below it is a zero, which is the
entire node.

It clears the chrome comfortably. The dismiss cross is two diagonals; this has a
horizontal. The arrow has a head. Nothing else in the set is a line crossed by a level.

### The other three collided with the language, not the chrome

The `×` lesson was that mathematical notation can collide with application commands. This
batch found the other kind: **transfer functions and waveforms collide with the response
and generator families, because those families already own that visual territory.**

```
Clip     a wave with flattened peaks   against Square: how sharp the corners are
Abs      humps on a baseline           against Formant: how narrow the peaks are
MinMax   the envelope of two signals   against Bandpass and Notch: point or plateau
```

Every one of those is a *detail*, not a silhouette. Rule 9 says fail, and two attempts each
did not rescue them — the clip was drawn as a transfer curve first (flat, ramp, flat, which
is the highpass) and then as its output; the rectifier was drawn as bare humps first and
then on a baseline, which helped and not enough.

The ring does not rescue them either. Its interior is under three pixels at header size,
which carries a plus and a cross and nothing larger.

So three cells are reserved, and the marks stay drawn and unassigned — evidence, and a
note to whoever tries again that these particular drawings have already been tried. That
is now four unresolved glyphs, and they are honest ones: Phaser and Allpass because phase
has no picture, Clip and Abs and MinMax because the picture they want is taken.

### The finding underneath

The identity set is around fifteen marks that are all **a line doing something across a
field** — responses, waveforms, contours, transfer functions. That space is close to full,
and the next family that wants to draw a curve will find the same thing. A future batch
needing marks in this territory should probably reach for an enclosing structure the way
the operators did, rather than for another curve.

### Widths

Compare and Abs to Narrow, Clip to Standard, MinMax to Wide, by the validator at every
interface scale. Twenty-eight migrated types.

## Step 14G — the specialty batch

Six types migrated. **Two got marks, four ship with reserved cells**, and that is the
batch succeeding rather than falling short.

### Two of the priority groups do not exist

There are no DX7 or OPL2 operator node types. Those are **importers** — they read a
cartridge or a bank and build a graph out of the ordinary types, so there is no operator
object to migrate and no operator family to invent. That is the third time the rollout has
found a category that exists in the vocabulary and not in the registry, after the routing
nodes and the filter siblings.

### The results

```
A  mechanical migration
   Sampler              Wide       enclosure: two bounds with signal between them
   AudioInput           Narrow     the input seam's mark, shared

B  migrated, glyph intentionally unresolved
   Speech               Wide
   PluginEffect         Wide
   PluginInstrument     Standard
   CableTest            Narrow

C  held
   none
```

### The sampler is the first mark that is not a curve

Brackets rather than a box, because a box at header size fills in — the keyboard proved
that three ways. Two uprights leave the interior open, and the marks that say "bounded"
sit outside the content instead of around it.

It needed one optical cut. At full span the wave's ends touched the brackets and the three
marks welded into a blob; at header size the interior is narrower, shallower and half a
cycle instead of a whole one. What has to survive down there is that there is *something*
between two bounds, not which wave it is.

This is rule 9b in practice, and it worked: the open field was full and the enclosure was
empty.

### Why the four are reserved

**Speech.** The Noun Project's entire corpus for it is loudspeakers, microphones and
documents — equipment and paperwork, not a signal operation. Nothing to reduce and nothing
to converge on. The node is called Speak and the name does the work.

**The two plugin hosts.** Their meaning is that the processing comes from outside
SoundGraph's own vocabulary. The one corpus lead worth anything is a corner-bracket frame
with an arrow entering it, which is four marks plus content in a cell that holds about
two. Recorded for whoever tries again.

**Cable Test.** A diagnostic. There is no signal operation to draw.

### Two rules from the last two batches, now in the contract

**9b — the open field is full.** Fifteen marks are a line doing something across the same
square, and 14F had three candidates in one batch fail against marks already there. A
drawing whose distinction is a kink, a plateau, an extra peak or one stroke is not a new
mark. Reach for enclosure, topology, an object boundary, repeated structure or a spatial
relationship — the sample's brackets and the operators' ring are both that — or reserve
the cell.

**9c — empty is part of the vocabulary.** A reserved cell is a finished state. Six types
ship without a mark now and they look restrained rather than broken, because the cell is
reserved either way and the name is doing the work. Coverage is not the quality metric. A
mark that is nearly right is worse than none, because it teaches the reader something
untrue and they have no way to find out.

### Where the corpus stands

**Thirty-four migrated types**, six of them with reserved cells: Phaser, Allpass, Clip,
Abs, MinMax, and now Speech, the two plugin hosts and Cable Test — nine, once this batch
lands.

What is left is not specialty at all. It is one ordinary family nobody has done yet —
dynamics and the remaining modulation types: Drive, Crush, Compressor, AHD Envelope,
Arpeggio, Retrigger, Euclid, Scale Quantizer, MIDI CC, Note Triggers, Trigger Bus, Level's
neighbours. They belong in an ordinary batch, not this one.

## Step 14H.1 — dynamics and signal shaping

Four types, three marks, one reserved cell — and the batch found the second answer to the
saturation problem.

### The compressor establishes spatial territory

Drawn as another transfer curve it would have been one more line across the same square,
and there is no room there. Drawn as **a range narrowing** — a wide pair of bounds
arriving and a narrow pair leaving — it is a shape nothing else in the set has.

It took one correction, and the proof sheet said it immediately: at three tenths of a
reach apart the two bounds close to within four pixels at header size and the mark is the
disclosure chevron. **A pair of lines that comes to a point is an arrowhead.** Half a
reach apart keeps a visible channel between them, and a channel is what a dynamic range
is.

That is the second place rule 9b sends a new concept, after enclosure: **a spatial
relationship between two marks**. It also leaves room for a limiter or an expander later —
the same two bounds, closing differently.

### The crusher is regular against irregular

A crusher puts the signal on coarse, equal levels, so it is a staircase whose treads are
all the same where the sample-and-hold's are all different. That device already separates
a clock from noise and a sequencer from a held signal; this is its third use and it
carries cleanly at header size.

### AHD is an envelope

One family, one mark. The name says which implementation, the same way both noise sources
share a mark. No second envelope glyph was drawn, because there is no reason a reader
should have to tell an AHD from an ADSR by its header rather than by its name.

### Drive is reserved, and it is the same failure as Clip

Drive is saturation, and the honest drawing of saturation is a wave with its peaks
flattened — which is the square oscillator with rounder corners. **Corner radius is a
detail, not a silhouette.** That is the drawing that failed for Clip in 14F; it was tried
again here for the type it actually suits, and it fails for the same reason.

Worth recording plainly: the clipped-waveform drawing has now been rejected twice, for two
different types, on the same grounds. Whoever reaches for it a third time should reach for
an enclosure or a spatial relationship instead.

### Widths

Drive to Narrow, Crush and AHD Envelope to Standard, Compressor to Wide, by the validator
at every interface scale.

**Thirty-eight migrated types**, ten of them with reserved cells.

## Step 14H.2 — musical and event control

Seven types looked at, five migrated, two held. Verifying what each node actually does
before drawing anything changed four of the seven answers.

### What verification changed

**Arpeggio is not an arpeggiator.** It "steps the frequency once, part-way through" — two
levels and one riser, not an ordered pitch traversal. The mark drawn for it is that step,
and it separates cleanly from the square's alternation and the sample-and-hold's
down-and-up.

**Retrigger is a clock.** It "fires a pulse on a timer", so it wears the clock's mark.
Inventing an initiating-event-plus-repeats distinction would have drawn a behaviour this
node does not have.

**MIDI CC is a boundary.** A hardware knob arriving from outside the patch is what the
input seam already means, so it takes the seam's mark. Not a five-pin plug: the connector
is equipment, and what matters is that control enters here.

**Trigger Bus really is one-to-many** — "one wire in, eight pads out" — and **the split
finally has a production owner.** Step 10 drew it, step 10's proof sheet showed it works,
and it has been attached to nothing for eleven steps.

Note Triggers is *also* one in and eight out, and deliberately does not get the split. What
it does is turn eight chromatic notes into eight triggers — a transformation that happens
to have that port shape. The split would say distribution, which is the other node.

### The two held

For the first time it is a **width** rather than a glyph.

```
Arpeggio         needs about 433
ScaleQuantizer   needs about 587
Extra class                   416
```

A hundred and fifty units apart, so they are two outliers and not a cluster, and one
outlier does not earn a rung. Both marks are drawn — the arpeggio's step passed its
collision sheet — and both are waiting on a class decision rather than on a drawing.

Scale Quantizer would have been reserved anyway: snapping a pitch to the nearest note of a
scale is quantisation, and Crush already owns the coarse-levels staircase. The only thing
that would separate them is a small badge saying "pitch", which is a detail.

### Euclid survived

It draws the hits where the algorithm puts them — three in eight, which its own
documentation names — as equal uprights unevenly placed, against the clock's even
placement and the delay's decay. Three marks in the pulse family now, told apart by
spacing and by height, and none of them is a badge on another.

### Widths

MIDI CC, Note Triggers and Trigger Bus to Standard, Retrigger and Euclid to Wide.

**Forty-three migrated types**, twelve with reserved cells, two held on width.

## Step 15A — the inventory

`editor-godot/inventory.gd` enumerates the registry rather than remembering it, classifies
every runtime type, and measures the narrowest width each one is still valid at — by
binary search on a ladder of eights, not by trying the four classes. Class membership only
says which of four buckets a type fell into; the question is whether those four buckets
are where the corpus actually sits.

### The denominator

```
51 runtime types
   34  migrated
   11  migrated, glyph intentionally reserved
    6  held
   registry runtime types = migrated + held    yes
```

Forty-five of fifty-one are through the system. That is the real number the running
count was approximating.

### Three of the six are held for bookkeeping, not design

```
NoteInput          336   the bare terminal type
StereoOutput       296   the bare terminal type
seam:Input/audio     —   a seam kind
```

`seam:Input/note` and `seam:Output/stereo` are migrated; `NoteInput` and `StereoOutput`
are the same nodes reached by their own registry keys rather than through a seam, and
`seam:Input/audio` is the third seam kind that never came up because no example patch uses
one. None of them needs a decision. They were missed because the migration was driven by
what appeared in patches.

### The width evidence, and it changed the answer

```
Arpeggio          432
Slide             440
ScaleQuantizer    536      Extra class is 416
```

**Arpeggio and Slide are eight units apart.** That is a cluster by exactly the standard
that earned `Extra` — three types inside eight units, at 405, 410 and 413. Two is thinner
evidence than three, and both types are currently unmigratable without it, and they agree
with each other to the width of one grid unit.

Scale Quantizer is alone at 536, ninety-six above the next figure. That is an outlier and
its layout is the thing to look at rather than the class ladder.

Slide was held in 14C as a lone outlier at 433. It is not lone any more.

### What the histogram says about the classes

```
120-159   ##                  2
160-199   ##########         10
200-239   #                   1
240-279   ##                  2
280-319   ##############     14
320-359   ######              6
360-399   ######              6
400-439   #####               5
440-479   #                   1
520-559   #                   1

declared: 176   296   376   416
```

**Narrow and Standard sit on the two real peaks.** Ten types cluster at 160–199 and
fourteen at 280–319, and 176 and 296 are inside them. Those two classes were discovered.

**Wide and Extra cut a flat continuum.** Seventeen types spread almost evenly from 320 to
439 with no peak anywhere in it, and 376 and 416 are two cuts through that spread rather
than two clusters in it. They work — every migrated type validates — but they were not
found the way the lower two were.

**The widest gap in the ladder is between Narrow and Standard**, and three types sit in
it: TriggerBus at 184, StereoLevel at 192 and Sample & Hold at 200, each carrying about a
hundred units of slack inside Standard. That gap is a hundred and twenty units, wider than
any other.

Nothing was changed. This step reads.

## Step 15A.1 — two rungs, three sweeps, and one honest hold

**Fifty of fifty-one runtime types are migrated.** One is held, for a reason that is now
understood precisely rather than guessed at.

### Two rungs, both from the corpus

```
176   Narrow
208   Snug       new
296   Standard
376   Wide
416   Extra
448   Broad      new
```

**Snug** came from the widest hole in the ladder: Trigger Bus at 184, Stereo Level at 192
and Sample & Hold at 200, each paying about a hundred units of slack to sit in Standard. A
fourth member turned up while measuring the last seam — the audio input seam at 195 — so
the cluster is four types inside sixteen units.

**Broad** came from Arpeggio at 432 and Slide at 440. Two types is thinner evidence than
the three that earned Extra, and these two agree to within one grid unit and were blocked
by nothing else. Both validate at 448 and are migrated.

Narrow, Standard, Wide and Extra were left alone. The histogram shows the lower two on
real peaks and the upper two cutting a flat continuum, but a class does not have to be a
statistical mode — its job is a few repeatable footprints with tolerable slack, and those
two are doing it.

### The three clerical holds are swept

`NoteInput` and `StereoOutput` are the bare registry keys for terminals whose seam forms
were already migrated — the same nodes by another name, so the same marks. `seam:Input/audio`
is the third seam kind, which never came up because no example patch uses one; it was
measured through `_add_node` rather than a document, because a seam cannot be spelt into a
type field.

### Scale Quantizer: it can fit, and the fix is a rule rather than a squeeze

It stands at 530, and **one dropdown wants 224 of that.** The scale parameter is an
enumeration whose longest option is `minor pentatonic`, and an `OptionButton` is sized by
its longest option. Its neighbour, the root note, wants 90. Both sit on one row, because
the grid puts two parameters on a line.

So the node is not big. It has one control that is two and a half columns wide, and
another control beside it.

That is not a Scale Quantizer problem. It is a general one: **a control sized by its
longest enumeration can be far wider than a column, and two of those on a line is what
makes a node five hundred wide.** The rule that would fix it is general too —

> A parameter whose control needs more than one column takes a line to itself.

— and it would apply to any future type with a long enumeration. Putting the two on
separate rows would leave the node needing roughly the width of one dropdown and its
gutters, which is inside Wide.

**Not implemented.** `PARAMETERS_PER_LINE` is part of the frozen grid and changing it is a
layout rule, not a migration. Scale Quantizer stays held, and it is now held for a written
reason with a proposed fix rather than for being mysteriously large.

### The equation

```
51 runtime types
   39  migrated
   11  migrated, glyph intentionally reserved
    1  held        ScaleQuantizer, on a layout rule
   registry runtime types = migrated + held    yes
```

## Step 15A.2 — the spanning rule, and why it is not finished

The rule is right and the implementation is not, and the difference is worth writing down
because it is the same mistake in two sizes.

### What was asked for

> A parameter whose control's **validated minimum width** exceeds the width available to
> one standard column spans the full control region for its row.

Keyed to the control's measured requirement — not to a type, a name, a string length or a
class of Control.

### What was built

`NodeGrid.spans` **predicts** the requirement instead of measuring it: the descriptor's
widest reading, in the control's font, plus an allowance for the dropdown's chrome. The
packing loop decides its rows before any cell exists, so there is nothing to measure at
the moment the question is asked.

The prediction is wrong by a third. A dressed `OptionButton` holding `minor pentatonic` has
a real minimum of **224**; the estimate says **168**. Godot adds internals to a Button that
its styleboxes do not describe, and no amount of adding up spacing tokens finds them.

### And the threshold moved twice, for the same reason

**One column.** A dropdown's own chrome is over half a column, so almost any option word
cleared the bar. Thirty-two of fifty-one types reflowed to one parameter a row, every node
in the program got narrower and taller, and two shipped example patches ended up with
overlapping nodes. A fix for one node had become a redesign of all of them, and the
inventory diff is the only reason it was visible.

**Two columns.** Safe — one type reflowed, by eight units — but now the estimate is under
the real requirement, so the node the rule was written for does not span.

So the rule is present, correct in principle, tested on its own terms, and inert.

### What it needs

The packing loop has to **build its cells and then group them**, rather than group first
and build after. Then the criterion is the cell's own `get_combined_minimum_size`, which is
the number the layout will actually use, and the predictor goes away entirely.

That is a restructure of the row builder — the frozen grid's own code — and it is not
something to smuggle into the end of a width change. Reported instead.

### Where that leaves the inventory

**Fifty of fifty-one.** Scale Quantizer is held, still for a written reason, and the reason
is now one step more precise than it was: not "it is wide" and not "the grid lacks a rule",
but "the grid has the rule and cannot yet measure the thing the rule is about".

`design_test.gd` holds the rule to its own boundary — an option grown a letter at a time
until the rule flips, in every palette, plus a knob that must never span. That test does not
depend on `minor pentatonic` staying sixteen characters long, and it will still be true
when the predictor is replaced by a measurement.

## Step 15A.3 — measured row packing

**Fifty-one of fifty-one.** The grid measures its controls now instead of guessing at them,
and the guess is gone.

### The order is the contract

```
build the controls  ->  measure what they need  ->  group them into rows  ->  place the rows
```

rather than predicting a width, grouping on the prediction, and building afterwards. The
cells are constructed onto a hidden bench parented to the widget — so a Control that only
knows its size once it has a theme gets one, and so nothing about the measuring pass
reaches the node, an invisible child adding nothing to a container's minimum. They are
taken off the bench and into their rows rather than built twice.

That distinction is worth keeping beyond dropdowns:

> Layout may use a semantic descriptor to decide what a control **is**. Physical packing
> uses what the rendered control **measures**.

### The criterion had to become relative, and that was the real bug

Cells on a row take the same width — step 4's whole point, so the control on the second row
lands under the control on the first. Which means **a row of two costs twice its wider
cell.** Pairing a 224 dropdown with a 113 knob does not cost 337; it costs 448, and the node
pays a hundred and ten units for a column its narrow cell will never use.

So the question was never "is this cell bigger than some figure". No absolute threshold
could express it, and both attempts proved it from opposite sides:

```
one column    every knob cleared it — a knob cell is a dial and a name, already
              wider than the bare column figure. 32 of 51 types reflowed.
two columns   the Scale Quantizer's dropdown missed by two pixels. 224 against 226.
```

The rule asks instead whether a cell is **out of scale with what it would sit beside**:
wider than its widest rowmate by half again. Below that the pairing wastes less than a
third of a column and the extra row costs more than it saves; above it the narrow cell is
being handed a column it has no use for.

Scale Quantizer's two parameters sit at 224 against 113 — just under twice — and they are
the only such pair in fifty-one types.

### The regression gate

**One of fifty-one reflowed**, and it is the one the rule was written for: 536 to 424,
which validates at Broad. Every other type's narrowest valid width is unchanged to the
unit. No example patch gained an overlap, no node moved, no declared class changed.

`editor_test.gd` holds the rule on cells built for the purpose — an option grown a letter
at a time until the rule flips, at the two extreme interface scales, plus an ordinary knob
that must never span. It does not depend on `minor pentatonic` staying sixteen characters
long, and it measures the same way the packing loop does because it calls the same
function.

### The final equation

```
51 runtime types
   39  migrated
   12  migrated, glyph intentionally reserved
    0  held
   registry runtime types = migrated + held    yes
```

Twelve reserved cells: Phaser, Allpass, Clip, Abs, MinMax, Drive, Speech, Note Triggers,
the two plugin hosts, Cable Test and Scale Quantizer. Every one of them for a written
reason, and none of them looking unfinished.

**The node grammar is frozen.**

---

## Step 15B — the dense graph

The node grammar was frozen at 15A.3. This step does not change it. It builds one
deliberately hostile graph, photographs it from four distances in three environments,
measures everything a machine can decide, and files what it finds.

The specimen is `editor-godot/qa/dense-graph.json`: thirty nodes and thirty-five cables,
arranged to be unpleasant rather than to flatter anything.

```
all six width classes          Narrow (Add, Multiply, Drive, Gain) through Broad (Scale Quantizer)
every glyph family             generator, temporal, response, combining, dynamics, maths, edges
three reserved cells           Drive, Plugin Effect, Speak — two of them adjacent
one genuinely invalid node     Drive, drive 0.55 against a range of 1 to 30
the longest name and the shortest   "Sidechain Bus Compressor" and "Q"
two fan-outs                   the clock's gate to three places, the noise to two
a four-input mixer into another mixer
several cables crossing the whole graph, because their ends are at opposite corners
adjacent nodes from unrelated families   Clock beside Euclid beside Add beside Compressor
```

`qa_sheet.gd` renders it and audits it. Twenty-six pictures from the representative
corner — Lab, Paper and Maximum Contrast, at Comfortable and XL, at 100/66/40/28% — and
**eighty frames of machine checks** over the whole matrix, five palettes by four interface
scales by four zooms.

### What the machine settled

```
80 frames checked, 26 shots written
no complaints
```

- No migrated title is cut to an ellipsis at any zoom, scale or palette.
- Every node stands at its declared width class, to the pixel.
- Nothing is clipped, overlapping, or outside its own frame in FULL.
- The alert mark appears on exactly the node the validator complained about — checked
  against the validator's answer rather than against a list written here.
- Every reserved cell holds its cell and draws no texture.
- **The title column does not vary by a pixel**, across thirty nodes, five palettes and
  four interface scales. That is the numeric form of the claim the specification makes in
  its first section, and it is why the glyph cell is reserved rather than removed.
- The identity variant resolves: the filter at `mode: 2` wears the bandpass mark, and its
  dropdown says bandpass.

The decidable half of this is now in `editor_test.gd`, so it runs on every push.

### The ten questions

**1. Can the primary audio path be followed before reading labels?** Yes. Mint reads as one
continuous run from the oscillator through filter, gain, drive, comb, delay to the mixer and
out, and it is the only mint run in the frame that reaches the right edge. The control
cables are a different hue and a different shape of curve — shorter, more vertical — so the
audio spine separates without anything being labelled.

**2. Can audio, control and event signals be distinguished without labels?** At the sockets,
yes, and in colour *and* in grayscale: circles are audio, diamonds are control, and the
grayscale frame keeps both. **Along a cable, colour is the only channel.** In the grayscale
render every cable is the same mid-grey. A reader can always recover a cable's type by
looking at either end, so this is bounded — but tracing one wire through a crossing region
without looking at its ends is not possible without hue. Recorded against the cable design,
which is not part of the frozen node system.

**3. Do the glyph families feel like one language?** Yes. One weight, one field, one grid,
one ink, throughout — nothing is darker, larger, more detailed or more literal than its
neighbours, and nothing reads as chrome. The collision sheet (`glyph-collisions.png`,
eleven groups at the twenty-four pixel header cell) separates every pair the brief names.

One near-collision, recorded and not redesigned: **the envelope contour against the bandpass
hill.** Both are a peak; the difference is symmetry and the decay tail. They are never in
the same role — the envelope is worn by ADSR and AHD, the bandpass only ever as the third
variant of a filter's mode — so the word beside the mark always disambiguates. Three other
pairs are deliberate mirrors (input against output seam, mixer against trigger bus, comb
against formant), where direction or inversion *is* the semantic difference.

**4. Do reserved glyph cells look intentional?** Yes, and this is the sheet to look at
(`reserved-cells.png`): twelve empty cells in a column with three glyph-bearing headers
underneath them for scale. They read as a set of nodes whose identity is the word rather
than a set of unfinished nodes, and the title column is unmoved — measured, not eyeballed.
A blank cell causes **less** confusion than a bad glyph would, because the eye goes straight
to the name instead of trying to decode a mark that means nothing.

> **A reserved identity cell is an intentional terminal state, not incomplete work.**

That is now written into `docs/graph-node-system.md`. There is no target of 100% icon
coverage and pressure toward one should be refused.

**5. Does any node attract attention for a non-semantic reason?** One does: **Plugin
Effect**, and not for any reason in the node grammar. At 40% and 28% it is the only node in
the frame with three little buttons drawn on it, and the eye goes there first. See B1 below.
Otherwise no — the widths repeat, the header tints are quiet, the alert is a single mark,
and the warning treatment on Drive is legible without dominating.

**6. Does the graph truly simplify as zoom decreases?** Mostly, and this is where the two
defects live. The bands do their job: controls go, values become words, then words go and
the node becomes a named silhouette with sockets. There are no orphaned values at FULL and
no accidental microtext from the row system. But there **is** microtext from outside it —
five buttons and a step grid that no band ever hides — and there **are** orphaned values at
REDUCED. Both below.

**7. Is every node identity intentional at MAP scale?** Yes. Zero ellipses in eighty
frames. The interesting case is Drive: at 28% its Narrow class leaves 37 real pixels, the
compact name "Drive" needs about 45 at the legibility floor, and so it draws **nothing** —
while "Add" beside it, three characters, still draws. That asymmetry is the rule working
rather than failing: remove information rather than reduce its legibility. The node is still
identifiable by its warning tint, its position and its cables.

**8. Do width classes create rhythm?** Yes, visibly. In the 40% frame the Wide column
(Delay, Comb, Sampler, Speech, Plugin Effect) lines up as a column, and the Narrow nodes
(Add, Multiply, Drive, Gain) read as a family of small operators rather than as four
different accidents. Snug earns its place: Sample and Hold and Trigger Bus at 208 sit level
with the Narrow group instead of paying a hundred units of slack to be Standard. Broad does
not look like an oddball — Scale Quantizer at 448 after the reflow is an ordinary two-row
node with a dropdown on each row, and it is the widest thing in the frame in the same way
the mixer is the tallest.

**9. Can state channels coexist in density?** Yes, in one frame: Filter is selected (mint
perimeter), Delay is hovered (lifted surface), Drive is unwell (tinted header and alert
mark), the output ports carry activity, and sockets throughout are filled or hollow by
connection. No channel erases another, and all five are still separable at 40%.

**10. Can the patch be understood globally before locally?** Yes. At 40% the graph reads
left to right as sources (clock, keyboard, audio in, CC, note triggers) → generators and
patterns (Euclid, Steps, Saw, Noise, LFO) → modulation and utility (Add, Multiply, S&H,
Scale, Envelope) → transformation (Filter, Gain, Drive, Comb, Delay, Comp) → combination
(Voices into Master) → Output. Nobody arranged that reading; it falls out of the cables and
the repeated widths. **This was the finish line, and it holds.**

### Accessibility

The grayscale renders are the test the redundant channels were designed for.

| Channel | Survives grayscale |
|---|---|
| signal type at a socket | **yes** — circle against diamond |
| connected against unconnected | **yes** — filled against outline |
| selection | **yes** — perimeter luminance, not only mint |
| health | **yes** — the header tint is a luminance change, not only amber |
| identity | **yes** — mark and word, neither of them coloured |
| signal type along a cable | **no** — hue only |

Five of six. The contrast gate that caught the warning-header problem at step 11 still
holds every palette at 7:1.

### The findings, categorized

The brief's four buckets, and only the fourth may reopen the frozen system.

#### SYSTEMIC DESIGN DEFECT — one

**At REDUCED a parameter can arrive as half a pair.**

The contract says REDUCED shows "values and control state as words". What it actually shows,
measured by asking the renderer's own `ScreenText.fit_for` rather than by reading pixels:

```
                   whole   name only   value only   neither
Compact     66%       69          11           12         5     28 of 97 incomplete
Comfortable 66%       84           3            8         2     13 of 97 incomplete
```

So a reader at 66% sees `cutoff` with no number beside it and a bare `4` with no word
beside it. **An unlabelled 4 is not information; it is a puzzle.**

The cause is a real gap rather than a slip. `Fit.NO_ROOM` — "its box is too narrow to hold
it honestly, so it is not drawn" — is correct and is the governing rule working. But it
decides **per label**, and a parameter is **a pair**. Nothing anywhere states what the unit
of removal is, so half a pair gets removed and the reader is left with the worse half.

Evidence across independent types and contexts: Master Clock, MIDI CC, Main Oscillator,
Scale Quantizer, Note Triggers, Filter, Delay, Comb, Amp Envelope — at two interface scales,
in every palette. That meets the bar the brief set.

The candidate rule is small and additive:

> **A parameter's name and its value are removed together. The unit of removal at reduced
> detail is the cell, not the label.**

**Not implemented.** The system is frozen and this is LOD behaviour; it is put here as the
one thing 15B found that is entitled to reopen it.

#### BUG — two

**B1. Six controls survive into MAP.** The plugin host's three buttons ("Absent Hall",
"Slots…", "Panel"), the MIDI CC learn button, the Speech words button and the Step
Sequencer's step grid are still drawn at 40% and 28%, at every interface scale. The contract
says MAP draws no control. They are all controls the row system never owned, so
`_apply_detail` was never asked about them — the rule is right and is simply not reaching
them. Gated at the known figure in `editor_test.gd` so a sixth cannot arrive unnoticed.

**B2. Load-time diagnostics never reach the health channel.** `_show_diagnostics` is fed by
`engine.validate_patch`, which parses and validates a *document*. `plugin_unavailable`,
`implausible_latency` and build-time buffer failures are raised later, when `load_patch`
actually builds the nodes, and nothing in the editor reads `get_diagnostics_json()`. Proved
by the QA patch: the engine says

```
Node 'drive' sets 'drive' outside its range; it will be clamped.   (parameter_out_of_range)
Node 'plug' plays through 'Absent Hall' by Nobody, which is not available here.
                                                                  (plugin_unavailable)
```

and the graph flags only `drive`. A node hosting a missing plugin shows no alert. This is
the editor's diagnostics plumbing, not the node grammar.

#### CONTENT / METADATA — none

Every compact name, descriptor and class in the dense graph is right.

#### COMPOSITION — one, fixed

The specimen originally named its output mixer "Bus" while the Trigger Bus's compact name is
also "Bus", so two unrelated nodes read the same at MAP. Renamed to "Master". A property of
the sample patch, not of the system — but worth recording that the language does not stop
an author choosing a name that collides with somebody's compact name.

### Definition of done

```

```

**15B passes**, with one legitimate reason to reopen the frozen grammar and two
implementation bugs to clean up. That is 15B.1, below.

---

## Step 15B.1 — node system closure

Three findings from 15B, fixed. One of them was allowed to reopen the frozen grammar; the
other two were bugs against rules that already existed. Nothing else moved: no icon, no
width, no spacing token, no type size, no state, no threshold, no title behaviour.

### The one rule that was added

> **A parameter cell is the unit of level-of-detail removal. Its name and its value appear
> together or not at all.**

`ScreenText.cell_reaches()` is the decision, `_draw_pairs` is the only caller, and nothing
ranks the halves. The old code did rank them — its comment said "the value goes, because a
name with no number still says what the node has and a number with no name says nothing" —
and that priority was the mistake. Both universal orders had already been tried and
rejected elsewhere for the same reason: half a statement is not a smaller statement.

The measurement, before and after, over the dense graph's ninety-seven parameter cells:

```
                       whole   name only   value only   neither
Compact     66%  was      69          11           12         5
                 now      69           0            0        28
Comfortable 66%  was      84           3            8         2
                 now      84           0            0        13
Compact    100%  was      96           1            0         0
                 now      96           0            0         1
```

**No cell that was whole became absent.** Every split cell moved from split to absent and
nothing else moved, which is the strongest evidence available that this was an atomicity
correction and not a density change.

Checked at a hundredth either side of every band boundary as well as at the four named
zooms, because atomicity is a per-frame property and four zooms cannot prove it — what
would break it is a cell whose two halves cross their own thresholds one frame apart.
Across every zoom, straddle and interface scale: **0 split cells.**

One cost, recorded. At Compact, and in the 86–89% straddle at every scale, the Keyboard's
`transpose` cell now loses its name as well as its number. Control visibility did not
change, so the knob is still drawn: the reader gets an unlabelled dial rather than a
labelled one with no figure. One cell of ninety-seven, at the tightest interface scale.

#### Two false starts, both instructive

The first attempt claimed every compensated cell for the pair pass and refused the ones it
could not lay out. That took **ninety-one of ninety-seven** parameters off the screen at
66%. The reason is worth keeping: most compensated cells are not drawn by the pair pass at
all — the generic pass in `_draw_labels` gives each label the slot between its neighbours,
which is wider than the half-row the pair pass allocates, so it succeeds where the row
split does not. The fix was to make the atomicity decision *before* any layout is attempted
and hand the cell back to the generic pass **whole** when the row split will not hold it.

The second was in the audit rather than the code: `qa_reduced.gd` went on reporting the old
numbers exactly, because it asked each label `fit_for` and the decision had moved to the
cell. A probe that measures the thing that used to decide will report that nothing has
changed, forever. The renderer now records its verdict on the row — stamped with the zoom
it was reached at, so a stale answer cannot be read as a fresh one — and the audit reads
that, for the same reason `fit_for` was split out in the first place.

### Two bugs, fixed structurally

**Six controls survived into MAP.** Not fixed with six `hide()` calls:

> **Every interactive body control declares the lowest optical state it may appear in. The
> default is FULL.**

`NodeOptical.requires()` at the construction site, `floor_of` and `survives` to read it,
`_apply_body_optics` to enforce it. A widget is for aiming at and there is nothing to aim
at past FULL, so anything that survives further has to say so and say why. The plugin
host's three buttons, the CC learn button and the speech words button are Buttons and are
governed by the default; the sequencer's step lane paints itself and declares FULL
explicitly. The seventh control somebody adds tomorrow is governed the day it exists.

The sweep skips control zones, which `_apply_cell_detail` already owns — two authorities
over one control is how a widget ends up flickering between two opinions of itself — and
it remembers the previous visibility rather than assuming `true` at FULL, because the
plugin's panel button appears only when the plugin has a face.

**Load-time diagnostics reached nobody.** Two sources, one health state, one channel:

```
document validation  (validate_patch)
        +
build diagnostics    (get_diagnostics_json, after load_patch)
        ↓
node health state
        ↓
header validity treatment
```

No new visual state — the validity channel is what this is for, it is designed, gated at
7:1 and proven. The two sources overlap, so they are deduplicated on code and message
before presentation; without that a clamped parameter would be reported and counted twice.
And the step 11 rule is intact: health never recolours a signal port or a cable.

The QA patch shows the result. It was flagging `drive` alone; it now flags
`["drive", "plug"]`, and the Problems panel carries both messages once each.

### The reruns

```
qa_reduced   0 split cells across every zoom, straddle and interface scale
             no control aimable at REDUCED or MAP, at any scale
qa_sheet     80 frames checked, 26 shots written, no complaints
             the validator is unhappy with: ["drive", "plug"]
inventory    51 runtime types: 39 migrated, 12 with a reserved glyph, 0 held
             registry runtime types = migrated + held: yes
width_sheet  48 placeable types, every verdict "ok" — no class moved
editor_test  no title cut, every node inside its class, nothing clipped,
             the title column holds, 0 controls past FULL, 0 half pairs
```

`editor_test.gd` now gates both new rules on the dense graph, headlessly: no control
survives past FULL, and `cell_reaches` never says a cell reaches the reader while one of
its halves does not. The pictures stay in `qa_reduced.gd`, which needs a rendering server
for the same reason `state_sheet` and `optical_sheet` do.

### What is deliberately not fixed here

**Cable signal type is hue-only between its endpoints.** The grayscale render showed it and
it is real, but it is not a graph-node defect: the sockets carry shape redundancy at both
ends, so a reader can always recover a cable's type by looking at either one. What is lost
is tracing a wire through a crossing region without looking at its ends.

Filed as the next cable-system problem rather than patched here. A dash, an inline mark or
any other secondary cue applied across thirty-five intersecting wires changes the whole
graph, and cables deserve the proof-sheet process the nodes just had rather than a change
made in passing during node completion.

---

**The Cosmopolitan Graph Node Pass is complete.**

Fifty-one of fifty-one types migrated. Twelve identity cells deliberately empty and
documented as a terminal state. Six width classes derived from the corpus. One packing rule
measured rather than predicted. One atomicity rule, added on evidence, after the freeze and
under protest of the freeze. Everything specified in `docs/graph-node-system.md` and gated
in `editor_test.gd`.

Any future node is a consumer of the system unless it produces hard evidence that the
system lacks a semantic primitive.
