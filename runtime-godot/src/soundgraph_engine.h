// SoundGraph — the Godot binding.
//
// Godot is a UI and education frontend, not a graph authority (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
// So this class holds no DSP and no graph semantics of its own: it is a translation layer
// between Godot types and the same dsp-core that the native host and the browser use.
//
// Anything the editor needs to know about a patch — the node vocabulary, whether a
// connection is legal, what is wrong with a graph, what a wire currently carries — is
// answered here by asking the core, never by reimplementing it in GDScript. That is the
// whole reason this extension exists rather than a pure-GDScript editor.
