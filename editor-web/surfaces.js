// The three ways to run SoundGraph, and what it costs to reach each one.
//
// This page is one of them, so it is the natural place to say the other two exist — the
// complaint that started this was that the doorway gave no sign there was a building
// behind it.
//
// URLS ARE CONFIGURATION AND DEFAULT TO NOTHING. A surface with no `url` is announced but
// not linked: it says what it is and that it is not ready, rather than offering a link
// that 404s. Nothing here invents a deployment that has not been decided — the same rule
// the mailing-list endpoint follows.
//
// WHERE THE FULL EDITOR MAY LIVE IS NOT A FREE CHOICE. The Godot export ships a service
// worker, and a service worker's scope is the directory it is served from. Its caching is
// cache-first with no revalidation and updates land a visit late (see
// editor-godot/README.md). Hosted at or above this page it would take control of this page
// too, and the marketing page would become one that cannot be reliably updated. It must
// live in a directory BELOW this one:
//
//   /soundgraph              this page
//   /soundgraph/editor-web   the full editor, with its own worker scope
//   /soundgraph/desktop      the desktop download
//
// Relative URLs, so the same build works on localhost, on a staging host and in
// production without a rebuild. Locally the export sits at ./editor/; in production
// (the mutant-factory-website repository's routes) that same relative link 301s to
// /soundgraph/editor-web/, the editor's canonical home in R2. Same origin either way —
// the handoff is localStorage, and localStorage does not cross origins.
