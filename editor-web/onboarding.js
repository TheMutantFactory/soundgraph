// The first two minutes.
//
// The whole shape of this file is one rule: the visitor hears something, changes it, and
// understands why it changed — and only then is anything asked of them. Nothing here
// blocks the instrument, nothing here is a prerequisite for using the page, and the
// mailing-list panel cannot appear until the golden moment has already happened.
//
// The script it implements, step by step:
//
//   arrival    the promise, and the click browsers require before audio exists
//   hear       the whole patch, playing, before any machinery is explained
//   read       four sentences, left to right, each lighting its own part of the graph
//   invite     one control, named, with no Next button — the change IS the next step
//   golden     what just happened, and a toggle between Original and Your version
//   agency     where to go now, and the only place the mailing list can be offered
//   whole      a ring around the full editor's real button — the files it needs have
//              been prefetching since Start was pressed, so the door opens warm
//
// Two things are worth knowing before editing it.
//
// EVERY STEP AFTER THE FIRST IS NON-BLOCKING. Only the arrival screen is a modal, because
// only the arrival screen needs a gesture. The rest are coach marks: cards beside a ring
// drawn around whatever they are talking about. A visitor can drag a knob, play the
// keyboard or edit the JSON at any point during the tour, which is the difference between
// playing an instrument and completing software training.
//
// SILENCE IS A REAL PATH, NOT AN ERROR PATH. Audio can fail, and a visitor can choose to
// continue without it. When that happens the tour keeps working and keeps its mouth shut
// about hearing things — and the golden-moment milestone is NOT recorded, because it did
// not happen. A funnel that counts silent visitors as having heard the difference is a
// funnel that will cheerfully report success at the one thing this page exists to do.
