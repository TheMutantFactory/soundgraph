## Routing goal 1.1: makes every crossing-count disagreement explain itself.
##
##   godot --headless --path editor-godot --script crossing_semantics.gd
##
## Goal 1 reported two numbers for the same patch — the cord layer's twenty-six against
## this programme's own enumeration of forty-two, and seven against ten — and could not say
## why. That is not a tolerable thing to carry into an optimiser, because the next goal
## wants to make a crossing count an objective, and an objective nobody can reproduce is a
## way to lose a measurement quietly.
##
## The answer turned out to have two parts, and only the second one is about crossings.
##
## **First, they were not looking at the same drawing.** The editor opens in CATENARY cable
## style. The cord layer draws hanging curves; `_routes()` returns the PCB router's
## polylines. Different vertex counts, different shapes, different meetings. Any comparison
## between them was a category error, and the routing baseline's own figures are figures
## about the router's geometry rather than about the picture on screen.
##
## **Second, on one geometry, two counts remain and both are real.** A mark is a crossing
## treatment the layer paints; a meeting is a place two cables actually cross. They differ
## because `CableArt.crossings` takes the first hit on each segment of the upper cable, so a
## meeting near a vertex is reported twice and a second meeting inside one segment is not
## reported at all. Which number is right depends on the question, so this file reports both
## and names them, and `CableCrossings.tally` is where that naming lives.
##
## No exclusion rule changed here. The traits are described, not enforced.
