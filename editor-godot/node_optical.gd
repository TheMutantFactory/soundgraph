## What a node is at each distance, as a contract rather than as behaviour.
##
## The machinery already existed and works: `PatchGraph.Detail` has four bands, they are
## chosen by measured floors rather than by taste, and the step 1 baseline showed the
## editor already shedding parameter rows and then the whole control panel as the zoom
## falls. What it never had was a statement of what each band is *for* — and behaviour
## without a statement is behaviour nobody can hold to account, which is how a level of
## detail acquires a tiny knob that is technically drawable.
##
## Three states, mapped onto the four bands that produce them. No new thresholds: the
## names are put on what is already there.
##
## [codeblock]
## FULL      Detail.FULL                  the working node, edited in place
## REDUCED   Detail.COMPACT               still a node, secondary information gone
## MAP       Detail.SUMMARY, TOPOLOGY     a symbol in a signal-flow diagram
## [/codeblock]
##
## MAP is two bands because it has two cuts of one idea: SUMMARY keeps the port names,
## TOPOLOGY has not the room. Neither draws a control, which is what makes both of them
## MAP rather than a smaller REDUCED.
##
## ## What each state may contain
##
## [codeblock]
## FULL      identity glyph, canonical title, controls, parameter labels and values,
##           dropdowns, port labels, ports, every interaction and validity state.
##           The complete steps 3-11 node.
##
## REDUCED   title, ports and their connection, values and control state as words,
##           port labels. No aiming at anything: the controls have given their room
##           to the words that say what they were.
##
## MAP       silhouette, identity, perimeter sockets, cables, selection, validity.
##           Port names while they fit. Nothing else.
## [/codeblock]
##
## The rule underneath all three, which is step 5's and is load-bearing:
##
## > Font size participates in the level of detail. When room runs out, remove
## > lower-priority information rather than shrink required information below its floor.
##
## ## Identity, deterministically
##
## Canonical name if it fits at the legibility floor; the type's written-down compact
## name if it does not; an ellipsis only if neither. `ScreenText._name_for` is the one
## implementation. For a type that has been through the pass, a cut name is a **failure**
## and `optical_sheet.gd` counts them — there should be none, at any zoom, ever.

## Preloaded rather than named: `patch_graph.gd` has no `class_name`, and every other
## file that needs its bands reaches it the same way.
const PatchGraph := preload("res://patch_graph.gd")

## Where a body control says how far out it may still be drawn.
##
## The registration 15B found missing. `_apply_detail` walks parameter rows and the cells
## on them, because that is the machinery the pass was built around — and six controls in
## the library are not on a parameter row at all. The plugin host's three buttons, the CC
## learn button, the speech words button and the sequencer's step lane are each added
## straight to the node, so nothing ever asked them what distance they were for, and they
## were still being drawn at 28% where the contract says a node draws no control.
##
## Six `hide()` calls would have fixed those six. This is the structural version: every
## interactive body control declares the lowest optical state it may still appear in, and
## `_apply_detail` enforces the declaration. A seventh arrives already governed.
##

## The furthest-out state this control may still be drawn in.
static func floor_of(control: Control) -> int:

## Whether it is still drawn at this state. FULL is 0 and MAP is 2, so a control survives
## while the state has not gone past its floor.

	return state <= floor_of(control)


## Declares one. Called at the control's own construction site, so the claim sits beside
## the thing making it rather than in a table somebody has to remember to update.
static func requires(control: Control, state: int) -> void:
	control.set_meta(REQUIRES, state)


## What survives into each state, as the table rather than as an impression.
##
## `true` is a promise, `false` is a promise too, and "optional" means the renderer may
## keep it while it reads and may drop it when it stops. The point of writing it down is
## that the last row is a deliberate absence: nothing is added anywhere purely so that
## every state can survive every level.

##
## Selection and validity survive everywhere because they are the two facts a reader
## navigates by, and both are carried by colour over a region — a perimeter and a header
## — which is the one thing that does not get smaller.
##
## **The glyph is not on the band ladder at all**, and the step 12 sweep is what found
## that. It stands down with the title Label at the title's own compensation boundary,
## which at XL is around a zoom of 0.90 — inside FULL, above the FULL/REDUCED line at
## 0.875. So for the bottom slice of FULL the node has no mark, and the first draft of
## this table said it did. Two systems keyed to two different thresholds, which is the
## thing this step exists to notice.
##
## It is written down rather than corrected. The behaviour is right — a mark that has
## stopped reading should go — and moving either threshold to make a table look tidy is
## what the brief said not to do.
##
## ## Two departures the dense-graph QA found, and what 15B.1 did about them
##
## Both were written down before they were fixed, which is why the reasoning survives.
##
## **Six controls survived into MAP** — the plugin host's three buttons, the MIDI CC learn
## button, the Speech words button and the Step Sequencer's step lane — because every one
## of them is a control the row system never owned, so `_apply_detail` was never asked
## about it. Fixed at 15B.1 by `REQUIRES` above: a body control declares the lowest state
## it may appear in, defaulting to FULL, and the detail pass enforces the declaration. The
## rule was right; it simply had no way to reach a control that was not on a row.
##
## **At REDUCED a parameter could arrive as half a pair.** The table says values survive
## "as words", and what a reader got at 66% was sometimes a name with no number and
## sometimes a bare number with no name — 13% of cells at Comfortable and 29% at Compact,
## measured by `qa_reduced.gd` through the renderer's own `ScreenText.fit_for`. The cause
## was that `Fit.NO_ROOM` decides **per label** while a parameter is **a pair**, and
## nothing said what the unit of removal was.
##
## That was a gap in the rule rather than a slip against it, so it was the one finding of
## 15B entitled to reopen the frozen system, and it was reopened for exactly this:
##
## > **A parameter cell is the unit of level-of-detail removal. Its name and its value
## > appear together or not at all.**
##
## Implemented in `ScreenText._draw_pairs`. No font size, threshold, width, row geometry,
## control visibility, title or port-label behaviour moved with it — an atomicity
## correction, not a density change.
