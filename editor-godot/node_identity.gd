class_name NodeIdentity
extends RefCounted

## What a node is called when there is less room to say it.
##
## A node on the canvas has a name its author gave it — "Amp Envelope", "Main Oscillator"
## — and at some distance that name stops fitting the box it is written in. The editor's
## answer was to cut the name and add an ellipsis, which is how "Amplifier" became
## "Ampli…" and then "Ampl…" and eventually says nothing at all except that something has
## been taken away.
##
## So a second name, written down rather than derived. `compact` is an optical
## representation, not a nickname: it is what this kind of node is called when the label
## has to be short, chosen by somebody rather than produced by a slice.
##
## Keyed by type rather than by the name on the node, for two reasons. A person who
## renames their oscillator "Bass" still gets a compact identity, because what the node
## *is* has not changed. And an author cannot be asked to think of a short form for every
## node they name — the type already knows one.
##
## The compact name is used only when the canonical one will not fit. At every size where
## the real name fits, the real name is what is drawn.
##
## ## The reserved-cell policy, settled at 15B
##
## Twelve of the fifty-one runtime types have an identity cell and no mark in it, each for
## a written reason recorded beside its entry in `GLYPH` below. That is a finished answer:
##
## > **A reserved identity cell is an intentional terminal state, not incomplete work.**
##
## The cell is reserved rather than removed so that every title in the graph starts at the
## same x whether its type has a mark or not — measured at 15B across thirty nodes, five
## palettes and four interface scales, and it does not vary by a pixel. `reserved_sheet.gd`
## puts all twelve side by side with three glyph-bearing headers for scale, and they read
## as a set of nodes whose identity is the word.
##
## There is no target of one hundred per cent icon coverage. A future mark arrives when a
## type earns one under the nine rules in `GlyphGrammar`, or it does not arrive.

## The types that speak the new language.
##
## It began as three — a proving ground, so that the anatomy could be designed on
## something small enough to look at properly. It is seven now, which is every node in
## First Synth: the first patch where nothing is left over from the old generation and
## the graph can be judged as a composition rather than as three islands.
##
## The last two are seams rather than ordinary types. A patch's edges are nodes like any
## other on the canvas, they are keyed by the port they stand for, and the language does
## not have an opinion about which kind of node it is dressing.

	# SineOscillator, SquareOscillator and OnePoleFilter measure 413, 410 and 405 at the
	# Comfortable scale against a Wide class of 376, and no class holds them. Three
	# independent types inside eight units of each other is evidence for a fourth class
	# rather than for stretching a third, and a new class is a design decision and not
	# something a migration gets to make. See docs/graph-nodes.md.
	"NoiseOscillator", "Noise", "Phaser",
	# 14C: the three that were waiting on the 416 class, and the control family.
	# Slide is not here. It measures 433 at Comfortable against an Extra class of 416,
	# and one type 17 units past the top of the set is an outlier rather than a cluster
	# — the rule the class set grows by wants several independent types agreeing before
	# a rung is added. Reported in docs/graph-nodes.md and held for the next batch.

	# that is all there is to be consistent with.
	"Compare", "MinMax", "Clip", "Abs",

	# and for the first time it is a width rather than a glyph: Arpeggio needs about 433
	# and Scale Quantizer about 587, against an Extra class of 416. They are a hundred
	# and fifty apart, so they are two outliers and not a cluster, and one outlier does
	# not earn a rung. Their marks are drawn and waiting. See docs/graph-nodes.md.
	"Retrigger", "Euclid", "MidiCC", "NoteTriggers", "TriggerBus",
	# 15A.1. The inventory found three types held for bookkeeping rather than design:
	# NoteInput and StereoOutput are the bare registry keys for terminals whose seam
	# forms were already migrated, and seam:Input/audio is the third seam kind that
	# never came up because no example patch uses one. Same nodes, same marks.
	"NoteInput", "StereoOutput", "seam:Input/audio",
	# And the two that were only ever waiting on a width rung, now that 448 exists.
	"Arpeggio", "Slide",
	# 15A.3. Held until the grid could measure a control rather than predict it. Its glyph
	# stays reserved: snapping a pitch to a scale is quantisation, and Crush already owns

## The identity glyphs for the four that finished First Synth, and why each is what it is
## — see `docs/node-glyph-grammar.md` for the family rules they are built from.


## The mark on a node's header, by type.
##
## It answers "what kind of signal operation is this" before the title is read, which is
## why every one of these describes behaviour rather than equipment: a response curve
## rather than a filter, the amplifier symbol rather than an amplifier. A picture of the
## hardware would be the third time this pass has had to walk back out of a rack.
##
## Node identity and port semantics are separate systems, so these are drawn in the
## editor's own identity ink and never in a signal colour — a lowpass is not green
## because audio is green.

	"SawOscillator": Icons.Kind.SAW_WAVE,
	# And the control family draws the shape of a value over time. Angular against
	# smooth: the two marks differ in silhouette rather than in a detail, which is rule

	# "modulation" is a sinuous curve and everything under "sawtooth" is a ramp.
	"LFO": Icons.Kind.MODULATION,

	# Level and its stereo twin are gain stages, so they wear the gain stage's mark. Two

	"Level": Icons.Kind.GAIN_TRIANGLE,
	# 14E. Family follows what the mark means, not what the registry filed it under: the
	# delay is temporal repetition, the comb and the formant are response shapes, and the
	# allpass is nothing at all yet.
	# 14F. Compare is the only one of the four maths types that got a mark, and the other
	# three are the most interesting result of the batch: their drawings are transfer
	# functions and waveforms, and the response and generator families already own that
	# territory. A clipped wave against the square is a matter of how sharp the corners
	# are; rectified humps against a formant is how narrow the peaks are; a min/max
	# envelope against the bandpass and the notch is whether the top is a point or a
	# plateau. Every one of those is a detail rather than a silhouette, which is rule 9,
	# so three cells are reserved and the marks stay drawn and unassigned as evidence.
	#
	# The ring does not rescue them either. It carries a plus and a cross at header size
	# and nothing larger — its interior is under three pixels there.
	"Compare": Icons.Kind.THRESHOLD,
	# 14G. The sampler is the first mark in the set whose identity is an enclosure rather
	# than a curve, which is where rule 9b sends new concepts now that the open field is
	# full: two bounds with a piece of signal between them.
	"Sampler": Icons.Kind.SAMPLE,
	# 14H.1, the dynamics family: spatial rather than curved, which is the other place
	# rule 9b sends a new concept. A compressor is a wide range arriving and a narrow one
	# leaving — two bounds closing without meeting, because a pair of lines that comes to
	# a point is the disclosure chevron and the first proof sheet said exactly that.
	"Compressor": Icons.Kind.NARROWING,
	# 14H.2. Verified against what each node actually does before anything was drawn, and
	# three of the seven turned out to belong to marks that already existed.
	#
	# An arpeggio here is not an arpeggiator: it "steps the frequency once, part-way
	# through". Two levels and one riser, which is a different shape from the square's
	# alternation and the sample-and-hold's down-and-up.
	"Arpeggio": Icons.Kind.ONE_STEP,
	# Euclid spreads hits as evenly as they will go across a cycle, so the mark is those
	# hits at those positions — three in eight, which its own documentation names. Equal
	# heights unevenly placed, against the clock's even placement and the delay's decay.
	"Euclid": Icons.Kind.SPREAD,
	# Retrigger "fires a pulse on a timer". That is a clock, and it wears the clock's
	# mark. Inventing an initiating-event-plus-repeats distinction would have drawn a
	# behaviour this node does not have.
	"Retrigger": Icons.Kind.PULSE_TRAIN,
	# A MIDI CC is a hardware knob arriving from outside the patch, which is what the
	# input seam already means. Not a five-pin plug: the connector is equipment, and what
	# matters is that control enters here.
	"MidiCC": Icons.Kind.ORIGINATE,
	# And the split finally has a production owner. Trigger Bus "splits a trigger bus back
	# into its eight lanes: one wire in, eight pads out" — one to many, drawn since step 10
	# and attached to nothing until now.
	"TriggerBus": Icons.Kind.ROUTE_SPLIT,
	# Note Triggers is reserved, and deliberately not given the split. It is also one in
	# and eight out, but what it does is turn eight chromatic notes into eight triggers —
	# a transformation that happens to have that port shape. The split would say
	# distribution, which is the other node.
	#
	# Scale Quantizer is reserved too. Snapping a pitch to the nearest note of a scale is
	# quantisation, and Crush already owns the coarse-levels staircase; the only thing
	# that would separate them is a small badge saying "pitch", which is a detail.
	# And a crusher puts the signal on coarse, equal levels. Regular against irregular is
	# what separates it from the sample-and-hold, the same device that separates a clock
	# from noise and a sequencer from a held signal.
	"Crush": Icons.Kind.QUANTISED,
	# An AHD envelope is an envelope. One family, one mark, and the name says which
	# implementation — the same reasoning that gives both noise sources one mark.
	"AhdEnvelope": Icons.Kind.ENVELOPE,
	# Drive is reserved. It is saturation, and the honest drawing of saturation is a wave
	# with its peaks flattened — which is the square oscillator with rounder corners, and
	# corner radius is a detail rather than a silhouette. It is the same drawing that
	# failed for Clip in 14F, tried again for the type it actually suits, and it fails for
	# the same reason.
	# And an audio input is the patch's edge with signal entering, which is what the note
	# seam already is. One mark, two types, the word beside it saying which.
	"AudioInput": Icons.Kind.ORIGINATE,
	# Reserved, and each for its own reason. Speech: the Noun Project's whole corpus for
	# it is loudspeakers, microphones and documents — equipment and paperwork, not a
	# signal operation, and this node's own name does the work. The plugin hosts: their
	# meaning is that the processing comes from outside SoundGraph's vocabulary, and the
	# one corpus lead is a corner-bracket frame with an arrow entering it, which is four
	# marks plus content in a cell that fits about two. Cable Test is a diagnostic and has
	# no signal operation to draw at all.
	"Delay": Icons.Kind.ECHO_TRAIN,
	"Comb": Icons.Kind.RESPONSE_COMB,
	"Formant": Icons.Kind.RESPONSE_FORMANT,
	# Allpass has no mark. Its magnitude response is flat, which Constant already owns;
	# its phase response falls monotonically, which is the lowpass; and the Noun Project
	# has no signal-domain metaphor for phase at all — "phase shift" returns project
	# milestones and "Phaser" returns a ray gun. An arbitrary swirl would be a decoration
	# pretending to be an identity. The cell is reserved, as the Phaser's is, and the two
	# of them are consistent because they are the same unsolved problem.
	"StereoLevel": Icons.Kind.GAIN_TRIANGLE,
	# And the Phaser has none. Its family — things that happen over time — has not been
	# drawn, and the identity cell is reserved whether or not a type has a mark, so a
	# node with no glyph costs nothing and claims nothing. No glyph beats a misleading
	# one, and this is the first type to ship on that rule.

## A type may declare **one** parameter whose discrete values change what operation the
## node represents, and choose a mark for each of them.
##
## Narrow on purpose. The general rule "a glyph may depend on a parameter" would let any
## changing value drive identity, and identity would stop being identity — the whole point
## of the mark is that it says what this thing *is* while its knobs move. This says
## something smaller and true: a state-variable filter set to notch is not doing the
## operation a lowpass does, and drawing a falling curve on it is a lie the reader has no
## way to catch. It was one, until this: First Synth's filter happens to be in lowpass
## mode, which is why nobody saw it.
##
## The parameter has to be an enumeration and its options are indexes into the list. Every
## other type stays keyed by type alone unless it declares one of these.
##
## The **name** is not variant. A node stays what its author called it and what its type
## is called — `Filter` in the registry — while the glyph says which response is running
## and the dropdown says it in words. A node that renamed itself when you turned one
