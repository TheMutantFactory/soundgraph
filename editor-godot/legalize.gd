## Layout goal 2: the nearest fully legal version of the hostile authored patch.
##
## A **legalization witness**, not a layout algorithm. Goal 1 found that three of four
## arrangement comparisons never reach the readability tier at all — the verdict is settled
## at legalization and the interesting figures are never consulted — so nothing can be
## learned about readability by comparing arrangements of different legality.
##
## The fix is a third arrangement that is legal and otherwise unchanged:
##
## [codeblock]
## dense hand        6 overlaps, 3 trespasses, and the best readability of the three
## dense legalized   0 and 0, and as close to the hand arrangement as that allows
## dense auto        0 and 0, and 29 nodes relocated a median of 1330 units
## [/codeblock]
##
## With all three legal, the comparison finally reaches tier 2, and the difference between
## the second and the third is **the price the current arranger pays beyond what legality
## actually costs.**
##
##   godot --path editor-godot --script legalize.gd
##
## writes `qa/dense-graph-legalized.json` beside its source.
##
## ## The one objective
##
## [codeblock]
## overlaps    0
## trespass    0
## clearance   0
## [/codeblock]
##
## Everything else is collateral to be measured and **not** an objective to improve. No
## column optimisation, no crossing minimisation, no stage correction, no cable shortening,
## no area tightening. Those are later goals and doing any of them here would destroy the
## measurement this fixture exists to make.
##
## Among the ways to be legal, disturbance breaks the tie: fewest nodes moved, then least
## total displacement, then least worst displacement. That is a **fixture-generation** rule
## and not the production objective — it exists to answer one question, which is what the
## authored graph looks like after paying about the minimum possible price for legality.
##
## Moves are kept local on purpose. Only nodes that are themselves in an overlap or are
## crossed by a cable may move; a node that enters the movable set for any other reason is
## recorded with the reason, because "we had to move an innocent node" is a finding.
##
## And `admissible()` deliberately does **not** constrain these moves against tier 2. If a
## move that clears an overlap adds a crossing, that crossing is exactly the evidence this
## fixture exists to collect: the unavoidable readability cost of becoming legal, as
## distinct from the gratuitous cost of an arrangement strategy.

## straight line between two ports. That distinction cost this file its first draft: the
## cable router avoids obstacles, so a trial evaluated against an unrouted path reported
## twenty-six trespasses where the drawing has three. Reimplementing the router to make the
## search cheap would be a second implementation of the thing being measured — the mistake
## this repository keeps catching — so a trial is applied, drawn and asked instead.
