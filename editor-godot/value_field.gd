class_name ValueField
extends Control
## A number you can drag, type into, and put back.
##
## The readout beside a slider was a Label: it showed the value and did nothing. Every
## audio tool of any age lets you grab the number itself, because a slider 112px wide
## cannot resolve 20 Hz to 20 kHz — at the bottom of an exponential range one pixel is
## several hertz, and the only way to ask for exactly 440 was to drag until it said 440.
##
## Three gestures, all of them conventional:
##
##   drag          — coarse by default, ten times finer with Shift held
##   arrow keys    — one step, or ten with Shift; Home and End for the extremes
##   double click  — type it, and units are ignored so "440 Hz" and "440" both work
##   middle click or Alt-click — back to the parameter's default
##
## The keyboard route was the one missing, and it was missing for a reason worth
## writing down: every control in this editor is deliberately unfocusable, because
## the computer keyboard is the piano and a slider that keeps focus after a drag
## silently eats the next note somebody plays. That is a real problem, and the answer
## to it had been to make the whole interface unreachable without a mouse.
##
## The resolution is that focus is taken by Tab and handed straight back after a
## drag. Somebody who tabbed to a parameter is editing it and expects the arrows to
## move it; somebody who dragged it is still playing.
##
## The label still reads the same; it just also does something.

signal value_submitted(value: float)
## While a drag is in progress, so the caller can bracket the whole gesture as one undo
## step rather than one per pixel.

## Pixels of travel for the full range of the parameter. A whole screen width is about
## right for coarse: it makes the gesture feel like a fader rather than a hair trigger.

## Right is correct in a row, where a column of values lines up on its last digit and the

## number sits under its own name with nothing to line up against and an off-centre
## figure just looks like it slipped. Set before the field enters the tree.

## crosses any parameter; ten with Shift held.

## nothing to a Control's minimum — so this field's minimum height was zero, and any
## container entitled to take it at its word gave it no room at all. The text still
## drew (nothing clips it), which is worse than vanishing: in a knob cell the value
## painted straight across whatever sat below it, and on the node's last row it ran
## off the bottom of the node. The field is exactly one line of numerals tall, so
## that is what it declares.
