## An on-screen piano, and a window onto whether the editor is hearing anything.
##
## The computer keyboard is the instrument, which works until it does not: a slider that
## kept focus, a tab that took the keys, a browser that never got a click. When nothing
## happens there is no way to tell whether the patch is silent or the keypress never
## arrived, and the two have nothing to do with each other.
##
## So this does two jobs. It plays notes with the mouse, which needs no focus and cannot be
## stolen. And it lights up every held note whatever pressed it — mouse, computer keyboard,
## anything — so a key that stays dark says "the editor never heard you" and a key that
## lights up but stays quiet says "the editor heard you and the patch is the problem".
##
## The letters on the keys are the computer-keyboard mapping, which was previously written
## down in a README and nowhere the user could see it while playing.

## How wide a black key is against a white one. A real piano is 13.7mm on 23.5mm, which
## is 0.583; a little wider here because these carry a letter.
const BLACK_WIDTH := 0.62

## The white keys each black key sits between — which is the whole point of where it
## sits. One key is the sharp of the note below it and the flat of the note above, and it
## can only say so by straddling the join between them.

## Where each black key's centre sits, in white-key widths from the octave's left edge:
## exactly on the join between the two white keys it belongs to.
##
## Two things this is not. It is not the five hand-picked numbers it started as — 0.7,
## 1.7, 3.7, 4.7, 5.7 — which at 0.62 wide put the C# at 0.39 to 1.01, merely touching
## the C|D join with 98% of the key sitting over C. And it is not quite a real piano
## either: an acoustic keyboard shifts these so that every white key's *top* comes out
## the same width, which lands C# about two-thirds over C.
##
## Halved deliberately instead. The relationship this keyboard has to teach is that one
## key is the sharp of the note below it and the flat of the note above — the same pitch
## under two names — and a key sitting equally on both says that without a caption. The
## cost is paid by the white tops, which are no longer equal: D, G and A come out
## narrower than C, E, F and B. That is a real departure from the instrument, made with
## its eyes open, and it costs nothing in aim — a click above the black keys still falls
## to the white key whose column it is in.

# trade to make with it: the letters ended up at 3.6:1 — half this project's own floor
# for text — on the surface whose whole job is to be read while your hands are busy.

# Attention is bought back where it should have been in the first place: the dock frames

# Live properties rather than constants, for the same reason the scope's are: a static
# evaluated at class load keeps whatever palette was active then and ignores every
# switch afterwards.

## black keys reaching 59px, so every white key's letter was tucked behind the black key
## above it. The dock is a little taller now and the black keys a little shorter, which
## is what pays for the bigger type rather than the type simply being asked to fit.
