## The face of the whole file: the knobs somebody plays, rather than the graph that makes
## the sound.
##
## It needs no new idea in the document, because the document has had one since v1.
## `controls` is the performance surface — "deliberately separate from the DSP graph: the
## same parameter may be driven by a Godot knob, a browser slider, a DAW automation lane,
## a MIDI CC or a physical encoder without changing the graph", says the schema — and every
## example in this repository carries one. First Synth has seven. Collapse remaps them
## through a module's facade, expand brings them back down, and nothing in the editor has
## ever drawn a single one of them. This draws them.
##
## So a patch has a panel the way a module does, and it is the same kind of thing: a
## selection out of everything the graph could expose, in an order somebody chose, with
## names they chose. The wand puts knobs on it and takes them off.
##
## Values go through the rack's own signals rather than a second copy of the wiring —
## `parameter_changed` already lands in main._on_rack_parameter_changed, which writes the
## document and syncs whichever other view did not originate the change. Two panels
## showing one parameter cannot drift apart about what it is set to.

const Rack := preload("res://rack.gd")
const Seams := preload("res://seams.gd")

## How many *offers* to a line before wrapping. The knob blocks themselves are laid out
## as rack modules in rebuild(); this only shapes the ghost strip under them.
const PER_LINE := 2

## How many groups stack in one slot of the rail. A slot is the rack's module height,
## so at two a group gets half a module — which is what shrinking the faders bought.
const PER_SLOT := 2

## The title band on a block's plate, before UI scaling. Shorter than the rack's own
## TITLE_BAND of 40: that band has to clear a full-height module's mounting rail, and
## these blocks are half that tall, so the same 40px would be a third of the panel.
const BAND := 22

## Inputs that take a signal as *modulation* rather than as sound to be passed on.
##
## The one thing that separates a carrier from a modulator: both reach the output in the
## end, so plain reachability calls everything a carrier. What distinguishes them is
## whether the path gets there through one of these — an operator whose output only ever
## arrives at a `pm` input is felt, never heard.

## The gap between one module and the next, before UI scaling — enough to read as a
## break, and enough to hold the arrow that says what drives what.
const ARROW := 18

## The four parameters that make an envelope, and the letter each wears on the panel.
##
## When a node carries all four they are drawn as a row of vertical sliders instead of
## knobs, because an envelope reads as heights side by side — the sliders *are* the
## shape of the sound, which four dials never quite manage. All four or none: a node
## with only a `decay` has a decay knob, not a one-slider envelope.
const ENVELOPE := {"attack": "A", "decay": "D", "sustain": "S", "release": "R"}

## How far down an offer is turned: enough to read as something available rather than as
## something already on the panel. The same value the module's face uses.
