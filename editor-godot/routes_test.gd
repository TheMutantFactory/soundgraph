## Tidy routes' acceptance test, and it is mostly about refusal.
##
## The crossing-cost frontier found a sharp knee: on the legalized hostile patch several
## forty-unit moves each remove a crossing at zero or one inversion, and then the curve jumps
## to candidates costing thousands of units and dozens of reorderings. This operation lives
## entirely below the knee, so most of what it must be held to is what it must not do.
##
##   godot --headless --path editor-godot --script routes_test.gd
##
## The gates are about the **knee**, not about a particular fixture doing nothing. That was
## the original design and babble corrected it: the operation takes it from nine crossings to
## seven for two forty-unit nudges, which the single-move frontier had said was out of reach.
## What every fixture is held to instead is that nothing moves sideways, no run reorders more
## than one pair of neighbours per move, the stage vector never regresses, and a patch with no
## cheap win left is untouched.

	# so 5A concluded that placement had run out there.
	#
	# It had not. The operation takes babble from nine crossings to seven, for two
	# forty-unit nudges and a single inversion — better than any candidate the frontier
	# printed, and comfortably inside the knee.
	#
	# The frontier measured single moves from the resting arrangement. The operation is
	# iterative: it takes one cheap move, the drawing changes, and a second cheap move
	# exists that did not before. A Pareto sheet of single moves understates what a
	# sequence of them can reach, and that is a property of the instrument rather than of
	# babble.
	#
	# So the signature test is not "moves nothing". It is that whatever it takes stays
	# inside the knee: no sideways movement, at most one reordering per move, and the stage
	# vector no worse.
