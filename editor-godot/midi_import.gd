extends RefCounted
## Reads a Standard MIDI File into the shape the piano roll plays.
##
## A deliberately small reading, not a MIDI stack: note-ons, note-offs, and the
## first tempo, quantised to sixteenth-note steps. Formats 0 and 1 both land here —
## the tracks of a format 1 file are merged on their absolute tick times, which is
## what a format 0 file already is. Percussion (channel ten) is skipped: the roll
## drives one pitched instrument, and a drum map played as pitches is noise wearing
## a tune's clothes. Everything else a file may carry — controllers, pitch bend,
## sysex, markers — is stepped over at its declared length and left behind.
##
## The parser refuses quietly ({}) rather than guessing: a file that is not SMF, a
## SMPTE-timed file (division with the high bit set), or a truncated chunk all come
## back empty, and the caller says so in words.

## The piece's ceiling is the roll's, not a number of this file's own. It used to be:
## 256 here, written when that was also the roll's, and when the roll grew to 2048 the
## reader kept its old sixteen bars and quietly dropped four fifths of The Entertainer.
## One constant, read from where it lives, and the suite checks the schema says the same.
