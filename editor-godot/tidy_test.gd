## The stage/flow tidy's acceptance test.
##
## The risk is the same one Goal 3 faced and it is worth naming: an operation whose mandate
## is "improve agreement between topology and drawing" can drift into "produce a better
## drawing", and the second one is Auto-place. So the gates are mostly about what it must
## **not** do.
##
##   godot --headless --path editor-godot --script tidy_test.gd
##
## The proving grounds are the two legal hostile fixtures. `dense-graph-legalized` is a
## disciplined hand arrangement with 26 residual stage violations — a good tidy makes small
## improvements with small movements rather than deciding 26 means reconstruction.
## `babble` is the interesting one: 73 violations, 4 surplus columns, and perfectly legal,
## so it is where legalization correctly did nothing and this operation has to earn its
## place.
##
## **Zero violations is not the target.** The metric describes disagreement between topology
## and spatial order, not validity: feedback, fan-in, shared modulation and deliberate
## authored composition all leave residue. 26 to 18 for five small moves is excellent; 26 to
## 4 for thirty moves has failed the product intention.
