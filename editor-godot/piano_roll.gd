## The piano roll: a step grid whose lanes sit exactly over the keys that play them.
##
## In its vertical orientation — the default — time runs upward: the bottom row is
## step one, beside the keys it strikes, and pitch runs sideways, borrowed from the
## keyboard below rather than re-derived: the roll asks the keyboard for its range and
## its key layout every draw, so shifting octaves or widening the dock moves the lanes
## with the keys and the two can never disagree about where a note lives. The layout
## crib is the falling-note school (Synthesia, and Bosca Ceoil's pattern grid): white
## lanes are wide, black lanes narrow and shaded, because that is what makes the grid
## readable as *this* keyboard rather than as a spreadsheet.
##
## Horizontal is the other school — the DAW's: time runs left to right, pitch climbs
## the left edge with the low notes at the bottom. It trades the lanes-over-keys
## alignment for the shape most sequencers have taught, which is a real trade and the
## user's to make. Everything below speaks in two axes — pitch and time — and maps
## them to x and y at the last moment, so the two orientations are one grid.
##
## The roll draws and points; the document and the clock are main's. What is in the
## sequence arrives as the document's own dictionary, a click is only a signal, and
## the playhead is a row index somebody else advances.
