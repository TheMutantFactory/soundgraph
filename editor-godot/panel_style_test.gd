## Written because the styles were inconsistent in use: a panel would not show its new
## style until something else made it redraw, and one that was showing it would lose it
## again on a zoom or a trip through another view. One node in one style cannot catch
## that. Every node in a different style, rotated twice, can — a style that lands on the
## wrong module, or falls back to the patch's, is then a difference between two nodes
## rather than a colour nobody can check from memory.
##
## The rotations are +1 and then -2 for the same reason. Painting a node that has no
## style is the easy direction; the failures were in style-to-style, where an override is
## already on the widget, and in landing back on a style the node wore two steps ago.
