## Every runtime node type, and what the cosmopolitan system has done with it.
##
## The migration was run family by family, from the registry read by eye. This is the
## denominator: the actual list, enumerated rather than remembered, with every type
## classified and nothing left unaccounted for.
##
## It also measures the thing the width classes were guessed from three specimens and are
## now answerable from forty: the **narrowest width at which each type is still valid**,
## found by binary search rather than by trying the four classes. That is what a histogram
## needs — class membership only tells you which of four buckets a type fell into, and the
## question is whether those four buckets are where the corpus actually clusters.
