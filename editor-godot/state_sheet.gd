## Step 11's proof: can a reader answer five questions about a node at once?
##
##   which node is selected, which is merely hovered, is anything invalid,
##   is anything showing runtime activity, and which ports are connected
##
## State design fails when two legitimate facts reach for the same channel, so the
## specimens that matter are the combined ones — selected *and* hovered, selected *and*
## broken. Isolated states always look fine.
##
## Taken from the running editor on a real patch rather than from a mock node, because a
## state treatment that only holds up on a specimen built for it is not a state treatment.
## First Synth happens to contain all three proving-ground types: its Lowpass is the
## specimen (four controls, five ports, some connected and some not, an identity glyph and
## enough body to expose over-styling), its Amp Envelope is the ADSR stage prototype, and
## its Amplifier stands in the mixed-state group.
