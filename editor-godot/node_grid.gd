class_name NodeGrid
extends RefCounted

## The spacing system inside a graph node.
##
## Every figure the inside of a node is built from, written down once. Before this they
## were spread through the builder as `Design.SPACE_M` here and a bare `0` there and a
## height that happened to be 74, and the result was what you would expect: controls that
## had each been nudged until they looked right on the node somebody was looking at, and
## two nodes that could not be said to share a layout.
##
## Everything is a multiple of eight, or of four where a gap is inside one object rather
## than between two. The exceptions are named and there are none.
##
## Applied only to `NodeIdentity.MIGRATED` while the pass is being reviewed; the
## rest of the library keeps the old figures, which is what makes the difference visible
## in one patch.

## Between the body's edge and anything inside it. The same figure the header's name is
## inset by, so the name and the first control stand on one line.
const INSET_X := 12
## Under the header's rule, before the first row.
const INSET_TOP := 8
## Under the last row, before the body's foot. A node that ends flush with its own edge
## reads as cut off rather than finished.
const INSET_BOTTOM := 8

## Between one row and the next.
const ROW_GAP := 8
## Between two controls on the same row, and between a port's label and the controls.
const COLUMN_GAP := 16
## One control column. Cells share it, so the control in the second row lands under the
## control in the first instead of wherever centring left it — which is the whole
## difference between two rows and four islands.
##
## The builder already floors a name box at 84 and caps it at 132, so 84 is the width the
## cells were standing at anyway — the column is not here to make them wider, it is here
## to make them the same. 104 was tried first and widened all three nodes by twelve to
## eighteen pixels, which is a width class arriving early in a step that is about spacing.
const COLUMN := 84

## The port gutters are equal within a node and measured from that node's own longest
## port label — a rule rather than a number, because both halves of it matter.
##
## Equal, because this is what was actually wrong with the Lowpass: the controls sat in a
## box that expands to fill, centred between two labels of different lengths, so "mod" on
## one row and "cutoff Hz" on the next moved the whole control block sideways and two tidy
## rows read as four islands. Equal gutters give the control region one left edge and one
## right edge on every row.
##
## Measured per node, because a fixed figure is a width class in disguise. Eighty-eight
## pixels was tried, and the Amplifier — two short port names and one knob — went from 219
## to 314 to hold two gutters sized for a node it is not.

## Inside one cell: control to its name.
const LABEL_GAP := 4
## Inside one cell: name to its value. One micro unit today, the same as LABEL_GAP —
## its own name because step 5 is where the two may want to differ, and a token that
## does not exist cannot be changed.
const VALUE_GAP := 4

## A row carrying controls, and a row carrying only ports. Both on the eight, where the
## first was 74 and the second 28 — near enough to the rhythm to look deliberate and far
## enough off it to stop every row below them landing on the grid.
const CELL_ROW := 72
const PORT_ROW := 24


## What a node is allowed to let one port label do to its width. The Lowpass's longest
## gutter is 74 at base scale, so this does not bind today; it is here so that the first
## node with a genuinely long port name is clipped and recorded rather than dragging the
## whole system wider. A compact-label policy is a later question and this is the ceiling
## that keeps it from being answered by accident.
const PORT_GUTTER_MAX := 96

## The width classes, derived from the three specimens rather than chosen for them.
##
## Measured under the frozen step 3-7 language, at base scale: Gain stands at 170, ADSR at
## 294, StateVariableFilter at 368. The classes are those figures rounded up onto the
## eight, which is what the rest of the node is built on — 176, 296, 376. They are not
## equal increments and there is no reason they should be: a class exists to give the
## graph a rhythm of a few repeated widths, not to make a table of round numbers.
##
## There is no fourth class yet. One arrives when a node earns it, measured the same way.
##
## ## What the figure measures
##
## The **outer footprint** of the node in graph space, at base interface scale: the whole
## box a reader sees and a cable lands on, border and content margins included, before
## `Design.scale()` multiplies it by the interface scale. So a Standard node at XL stands
## at 400 real pixels and there is nothing else to add or subtract.
##
## ## And it is a width, not a minimum
##
## A declared class is the width the node is drawn at, full stop. That has to be said
## because Godot cannot say it: a `custom_minimum_size` only ever pushes a Control wider
## and nothing pulls one back down, so a node whose child asked for an extra pixel during
## construction and then settled stood a pixel over its class for good — the Output seam
## at 401 against a class of 400, while its own combined minimum agreed with the class the
## whole time. The width is therefore set as well as floored, once the tree has settled.
##
## One pixel does not matter. The invariant does: fifty more types would reintroduce
## emergent widths one pixel at a time, and a class system whose members are approximately
## their class is a set of suggestions.
##
## If a node's contents genuinely will not fit its class, Godot pushes it back out and
## `editor_test.gd` reports the node and the overflow. That is evidence for another class
## or another layout policy — a design question, raised rather than absorbed.
## ## Two rungs added from the inventory
##
## The class set was three specimens, then four types, and is now answerable from fifty.
## `inventory.gd` measured the narrowest valid width of every runtime type and two gaps
## in the ladder turned out to be real.
##
## **208**, from a three-type cluster in the widest hole there was: Trigger Bus at 184,
## Stereo Level at 192 and Sample & Hold at 200, every one of them paying about a hundred
## units of slack to sit in Standard. A hundred and twenty units between Narrow and
## Standard was the largest gap in the ladder and three types were sitting in it.
##
## **448**, from Arpeggio at 432 and Slide at 440 — eight units apart, both blocked by the
## same upper edge of Extra and by nothing else. Two types is thinner evidence than the
## three that earned Extra, and these two agree to within one grid unit and are otherwise
## finished, which is the difference between a cluster and a coincidence.
##
## Narrow, Standard, Wide and Extra were left alone. The histogram shows the lower two
## sitting on real peaks and the upper two cutting a flat continuum from 320 to 439 — but
## a class does not have to be a statistical mode. Its job is to give the graph a few
## repeatable footprints with tolerable slack, and those two are doing it.
enum Width { NARROW, SNUG, STANDARD, WIDE, EXTRA, BROAD }
const WIDTHS := [176, 208, 296, 376, 416, 448]

## Written once so the harnesses cannot drift from the ladder they are reporting on.
const CLASS_NAMES := ["Narrow", "Snug", "Standard", "Wide", "Extra", "Broad"]

## Which class a type belongs to. Metadata, decided here — a width that emerges from
## whatever minimum sizes the controls happened to ask for is not a class, it is an
## accident with a name.
## Measured, then rounded up to the smallest class that holds them. The four that
## finished First Synth all fitted classes that already existed, which is the first real
## evidence that three is enough — a class system whose first four arrivals each need a
## new class is not a class system.
##
## [codeblock]
## type                  natural   class
## SawOscillator           253     Standard
## LFO                     326     Wide
## seam:Input/note         350     Wide
## seam:Output/stereo      286     Wide      -- and this one is the interesting case
## [/codeblock]
##
## The Output seam measures 286 at XL, which is comfortably inside Standard, and it is
## Wide anyway. At the Comfortable interface scale its contents want 299 against a class
## of 296 — it fits at one scale and not at another, and the gate caught it.
##
## **A class has to be decided at a type's worst interface scale, not at whichever one
## somebody measured at.** The class figure scales linearly and the content does not: type
## sizes stop shrinking at `Design.TYPE_FLOOR`, so at the smaller scales the words inside
## a node are relatively larger than the box around them. Comfortable and Small are
## usually the binding cases, and XL — the scale every acceptance in this pass has been
## judged at — is usually the most forgiving.
##
## The other thing that says: **Standard has almost no headroom.** It was derived from one
## specimen, the ADSR at 294, and rounded to 296. The very next type to arrive wanted 299.
## A batch that puts several types in the 296-to-330 range is evidence to re-derive it
## rather than to keep sending them all to Wide.
##
## ## The fourth class the first batch asked for
##
## Wide has the same problem and the evidence arrived immediately. Measured at Comfortable:
##
## [codeblock]
## Noise                 290     Standard
## Phaser                326     Wide
## NoiseOscillator       354     Wide
## OnePoleFilter         405     -- no class holds it
## SquareOscillator      410     -- no class holds it
## SineOscillator        413     -- no class holds it
## [/codeblock]
##
## Three independent types inside eight units of each other, all just past Wide. That is
## the cluster that earns a class rather than one node being awkward, and rounded up onto
## the eight it is **416** — `Width.EXTRA`, added on that evidence and named plainly,
## because the useful thing is the metric and the assignment rather than a taxonomy.
##
## Which is the rule the class set is grown by, now that it has been grown once:
##
## > Classes are discovered from clusters of actual requirement across the corpus, not
## > chosen in advance and not stretched to fit one awkward node.
##
## ## And how a type is assigned to one
##
## > Assign the smallest class at which the node is still **valid** in FULL detail, at its
## > worst interface scale.
##
## Valid, not preferred. `width_sheet.gd` forces a node to each class in turn and asks
## whether anything actually broke — a refused width, a clipped label, a child reaching
## outside its node, two controls overlapping on a row, a body that reflowed and grew
## taller. The first class that survives is the class.
##
## The distinction is not academic and it cost a day. The old harness measured how wide a
## node makes itself when nothing constrains it and reported the state-variable filter
## wanting 411 against a Wide class of 376; the live editor showed the same node sitting
## at 376 and looking correct. Both numbers were real and **neither was the answer**. 411
## was a preference — a container asking for its most comfortable arrangement. 376 was
## only "Godot did not push it back out", which is not the same as laid out correctly. The
## forced-width validator says the requirement is 416, which is what it now has.
##
## Natural width is still reported, as diagnosis. It is not the selector.
##
## Sending three types to a class 130 units wider than they need, to preserve a set
## inferred from three initial specimens, would be the tail wagging the dog.

## Set by `width_sheet.gd` while it measures, and by nothing else.
##

## reports the class. And the other obvious reading — emptying the minimum and asking for
## the combined minimum — measures how far the contents can be *squeezed*, which is a
## different and useless number. What a type actually wants is the width it settles at
## when no class is imposed, so the harness suppresses the classes and rebuilds.
##
## A measurement hook rather than a feature. Nothing in the editor sets it.

## pixels instead of 376, while the text inside it barely shrinks at all — `Design.type`
## floors every size at `TYPE_FLOOR`, so at the Compact interface scale the words are
## relatively *larger* than the box around them. The forced-width harness found five types
## that fit no class at all at Compact and fit perfectly at every other scale, which is
## not five awkward types; it is a box being shrunk out from under its own contents.

## Whether a built cell is too far out of scale with its neighbours to share a row.
##
## The rule, and the one thing the packing loop asks:

## > A parameter spans the full control region when its validated control minimum cannot

##
## **Relative, because the allocation is relative.** Cells on a row take the same width —
## that is step 4's whole point, so the control on the second row lands under the control
## on the first — which means a row of two costs twice its *wider* cell. Pairing a 224
## dropdown with a 113 knob does not cost 337, it costs 448, and the node pays a hundred
## and ten units for a column its narrow cell will never use.
##
## So the question is not "is this cell bigger than some figure" but "is this cell so much
## bigger than what it would sit beside that pairing them is waste". An absolute threshold
## cannot express that: at one column every knob cleared it, because a knob cell is a dial
## and a name and is already wider than the bare column figure; at two columns the Scale
## Quantizer's dropdown missed by two pixels.
##
## Takes the **built cells**, not descriptors. Layout may use a descriptor to decide what a
