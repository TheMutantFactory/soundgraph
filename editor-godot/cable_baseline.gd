## Step 1 of the cable pass: what the cables are, before anything is changed.
##
## The node pass started this way and it was worth it — `graph_baseline.gd` froze the node
## boxes, port positions and cable ends so that "the same patch opens the same way
## afterwards" could be a claim about numbers rather than about a memory of a screenshot.
## This is the same move aimed at the routes.
##
## It measures the seven problems rather than describing them, because six of the seven are
## about density and density is exactly what an impression is bad at. "There are a lot of
## crossings" is not a finding. "Thirty-two crossings, of which fifteen are between cables
## of the same colour and none of them meet at under twenty-five degrees" is a finding, and
## it is one a later goal can be held against — and it already moved this pass's first
## question, because the shallow-crossing count everybody expected to be the problem came
## back zero.
##
##   godot --headless --path editor-godot --script cable_baseline.gd
##
## with CABLE_BASELINE_OUT naming a directory for the JSON.
##
## ## What it does not do
##
## It does not judge. Every number here is descriptive, and the thresholds below are
## reporting bands rather than acceptance criteria — nothing in this file says a shallow
## crossing is bad. Deciding that is the next goal's job, and a baseline that arrived with
## its conclusions already in it would be a baseline nobody could disagree with.
##
## It also does not touch the material. `docs/cable-design.md` is a finished, frozen
## subsystem — mass, shell, glint, shadow, plug, hang, departure, crossing occlusion,
## surface response — arrived at over ten goals. This pass is about **routing and
## legibility in a dense field**, which is a different layer, and the frozen figures are
## not in scope.

## The zooms the node pass judges at, so the two baselines can be read side by side.
const ZOOMS := [1.0, 0.66, 0.40, 0.28]

## A crossing at a shallow angle is the one a reader has to work at: two strands that meet
## near head-on separate by direction alone, and two that graze share a long stretch of
## near-identical path. Twenty-five degrees is a reporting band, not a verdict.

## Two routes count as running together where they are within this far of each other, in

## little over a cable width; fifteen degrees is close enough that the eye reads them as
## one rail rather than as two cables that happen to be near.

## rather than read from `connection_lines_thickness`, which is GraphEdit's figure and is
## not what gets drawn — the cords layer took the drawing over and asking the old property
## reports zero, which is what the first run of this file said the cable area was.
