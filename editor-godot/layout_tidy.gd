## Improving the agreement between a graph's topology and its left-to-right drawing.
##
## Layout goal 4, and its mandate is deliberately narrower than "make the graph better":
##
## > **Tidy this area: improve the correspondence between topology and left-to-right layout,
## > while preserving legality and disturbing as little authored placement as possible.**
##
## It is not a miniature Auto-place. The boundary between the three operations is the whole
## point of having three:
##
## [codeblock]
## Resolve overlaps    owns tier 1
## Tidy flow           owns a restricted part of tier 2
## Auto-place          keeps permission to regenerate structure
## [/codeblock]
##
## ## What it optimises, and what it only watches
##
## The four topology-derived properties, as an **ordered vector** rather than a weighted
## score, for the same reason the objective contract is lexicographic:
##
## [codeblock]
## 1  stage_violations   a later stage standing left of an earlier one
## 2  backward           a cable ending left of where it began
## 3  stage_spread       bands one logical stage is scattered across
## 4  surplus_columns    bands beyond what the graph's own depth requires
## [/codeblock]
##
## Crossings and cable length are **guards, not objectives**. A tidy move that increases
## crossings is refused while any non-worsening move exists for the same stage improvement.
## Beginning from the assumption that stage order must be bought with crossings would be
## assuming the answer; if the fixtures show the rule is too strict, the fixtures can loosen
## it.
##
## ## X strongly, Y reluctantly
##
## The single most important behavioural rule here.
##
## > **Stage tidy owns X strongly and Y reluctantly.**
##
## Horizontal position is what the topology has an opinion about. Vertical position usually
## encodes something the topology cannot know — oscillators grouped, modulation under audio,
## voices stacked — so a node is moved toward its stage band in X, keeps its Y, and is
## nudged vertically only to stay legal. Vertical *order* is never reshuffled because some
## other ordering would look tidier.
##
## ## A component moves as one
##
## Stages come from the condensation, so a strongly connected component is one stage unit.
## Forcing an internal left-to-right order onto a feedback loop is correcting it into
## nonsense, so the members of a component are offered the same offset and keep their
## internal arrangement.

## How far along the way to its stage band a node is offered, as fractions of the distance.
## Partial steps first: the objective is agreement, not alignment, and a node that only has
## to move a little to stop being a violation should only move a little.
const STEPS := [1.0, 0.5, 0.25]

## And the furthest one move may go, in grid steps.
##
## Without it a node whose stage band is three thousand units away moves three thousand
## units, which is a relocation whatever it did to the stage count — babble tidied four
## nodes a median of 2720 units before this existed. A bound turns the operation into a
## sequence of nudges that stops when it can no longer improve locally, which is what
## "tidy" means and what "arrange" does not.
const REACH := 8

## Vertical nudges, in grid steps, offered **only** to keep a horizontal move legal. Never
## as an improvement in their own right.
const Y_REPAIR := [0, 1, -1]


## Which stage each node is at, from the **whole** connected topology.
##
## Whole, even when only a few nodes may move. Deriving depth from a selection's induced
## subgraph would convince the algorithm that three middle nodes are sources, and it would
## then destroy their relationship to everything around them — a tidy operation that makes
## a selection internally consistent and globally wrong.

## the author's own arrangement made consistent — not a fresh one. A stage whose members all

## How much of the author's vertical organisation a candidate has rearranged.
##
## Goal 5A's metric, and it earned its place immediately: displacement alone is the wrong
## cost. Moving a node five hundred units through empty space can leave every relationship
## intact, while swapping two neighbours by a hundred changes which one is above the other —
## and vertical order is where a patch keeps what its topology cannot say.
##
## Counted as inversions: pairs whose relative vertical order the move reversed. On the
## legalized hostile patch one candidate removes a crossing for forty units and **zero**
## inversions while another removes eight for 3640 units and twenty-eight, and displacement
## alone cannot tell those two apart.

## The most vertical order a cheap crossing win may rearrange.
##
## One, from the frontier rather than from taste. The cheap end of the curve sits at zero or
## one inversion and forty to a hundred and twenty units; past that it jumps to thirteen and
## twenty-eight, which is a different operation wearing this one's name.
