## A small platformer, so that "patches are game sounds" is something you can hear rather
## than something you have to be told.
##
## The game is deliberately crude — hand-rolled physics, rectangles for scenery, no
## sprites. It is not the exhibit. The exhibit is `game_sounds.gd` next door and the six
## lines in this file that call it, and anything more elaborate here would bury them.
##
## What it is for: a Godot user asking "how would I use this?" gets an answer they can run,
## and then the answer they cannot get from a .wav — open the Graph tab, change the jump
## patch, come back, and the jump sounds different. No reimport, no rebuild. That is the
## whole argument for shipping instructions instead of recordings, and it takes about ten
## seconds to demonstrate.

## — so the play area ran to the edges with nothing framing it and the empty half of the
## screen read as rendering having stopped rather than as a game 960 wide. A stage says
## where the game is: the aspect is kept, the rest is backdrop, and the size is written
## down so nobody has to guess whether what they are seeing is the whole of it.
