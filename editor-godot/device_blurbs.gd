## What the add-node dialog says about each instrument on its shelves.
##
## Every device row used to introduce itself with the same sentence — "device — a
## whole patch as one node" — which is a definition, not an introduction, and two
## hundred instruments wearing one name tag is a wall. The words live here, in the
## editor, rather than in the patch files: half those files are written by importers
## whose descriptions honestly describe the import ("imported by tools/dx7-import.mjs
## from algorithm-demos.syx"), and hand-editing generated files is how generated
## files stop being generated.
##
## Curated where the instrument has a story, derived where a family shares one, and
## searchable either way: the palette matches queries against these words too, so
## "pick" finds the Plucked String without anybody knowing its name.


## The instruments with stories of their own.
