# The platonic view of a patch.
#
# Wires shows where somebody dragged things. Face shows the instrument. This shows the
# graph itself: what is connected to what, on a grid nobody has moved, laid out by the
# only thing that is actually true about a patch — which signals feed which.
#
# So positions are computed rather than stored, and dragging is not offered. A node sits
# in the column its distance from a source puts it in, and the columns march left to
# right the way the signal does. Two patches that mean the same thing look the same here
# even if one of them was drawn by somebody in a hurry.
#
# Read-only on purpose. The moment this could be rearranged it would need to remember the
# rearrangement, and then it would be a second Wires with worse tools. The whole value is
# that it owes nothing to how the file was drawn.
#
# The look is the one the web page uses for the same job: a card per node carrying its
# name, what kind of thing it is, and its id; audio along the thick lines and control
# along the thin ones.
