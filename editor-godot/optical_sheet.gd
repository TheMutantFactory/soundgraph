## Step 12's audit: does the adaptive-detail machinery honour an explicit contract?
##
## The machinery is not new. Step 1 measured it, and it already sheds parameter rows and
## then the whole control panel as the zoom falls; what it has never had is a written
## statement of what each band is *for*, which is the difference between behaviour and a
## contract. `NodeOptical` is the statement and this is the check.
##
## Two things it does that a screenshot cannot:
##
## **It sweeps.** Testing at 100, 66, 40 and 28 tells you what four zooms look like. What
## goes wrong in a level-of-detail system goes wrong at the *transitions* — a title
## jumping, a value orphaned by the control it belonged to, a name reaching for its
## compact form early. So every boundary is crossed at a hundredth either side and both
## sides are recorded.
##
## **It counts ellipses.** The step 3 rule is canonical, then the written-down compact
## name, then and only then a cut. For a type that has been through the pass a cut is a
## failure, and the sweep reports the number rather than leaving it to somebody's eye.
