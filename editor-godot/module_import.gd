## Adds an existing patch into the one being edited, as a module.
##
## There is no sub-graph in the patch format and there deliberately is not going to be one:
## a nested graph is a second thing every target has to understand, and the promise is that
## one file runs everywhere. So a module is *inlined* — its nodes are copied in with their
## ids prefixed, and from that moment they are ordinary nodes. The imported patch is a
## starting point, not a live reference, and editing the original later changes nothing
## here. That is a real limitation and the honest one: the alternative is a format where
## opening a patch means resolving links to files you may not have.
##
## What gets left behind: the imported patch's own terminals. A patch that ends in a
## StereoOutput is a finished sound, and pasting a second output into a graph that already
## has one is not a module, it is a collision. The nodes that fed those terminals are the
## module's edges, and wiring them up is the user's job — which is the same job they would
## have with a hardware module, and takes about as long.

## Separates a module name from the node's own id: "echo.delay".
##
## A dot rather than the slash this first used. Node ids are ^[A-Za-z0-9_.:-]+$ in
## schema/patch.schema.json, so a slash produced files that our own parser happily accepted
## and a conforming validator would reject — an interop bug that would only have surfaced
## in somebody else's implementation.

## Terminals belong to a finished patch, not to a module. Which ones those are comes from

## needs no edit. A seam carrying a host binding is one too — that is the whole of what
## the binding means — and it has no registry entry of its own, so it is asked about
## first. Missing this let an imported game sound keep the keyboard that was driving it,
## and the module arrived with its gate already held down by somebody else's patch.
