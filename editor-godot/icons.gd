class_name Icons
extends RefCounted
## A small icon set, drawn rather than typed.
##
## The editor was using Unicode symbols as icons — ▸ for disclosure, ● for unsaved, ✓ for
## valid, ■ for silence, ▶ for fire. Seven of the twelve are not in Atkinson Hyperlegible
## Next, so they rendered as tofu boxes, and nothing in the build said so: a missing glyph
## is not an error, it is a rectangle. Software with little boxes in it reads as unfinished
## no matter how much care went into everything else.
##
## Drawn here instead, for three reasons beyond fixing that. They scale with the UI scale
## rather than with whatever size the font happens to draw a symbol at. They take a colour,
## so an icon can sit in the ink ladder like everything else. And they cannot go missing —
## there is no font, no icon file and no dependency to fail to load.
##
## Kept deliberately plain: one stroke weight, one grid, no detail that survives being 14px
## on a projector. `icons_test.gd` renders every one and checks it actually marks pixels,
## because an icon that silently draws nothing is the same failure in a new hat.

## Consistent across the set. A single weight is most of what makes an icon set look like a
## set rather than a collection.
const STROKE := 2.0

## Below this, a glyph may be drawn differently rather than smaller.
##
## Optical sizing, which is what a type designer does when a face is cut for eight point:
## not the same drawing scaled down, but the same idea drawn for the space it has. Three
## marks here take it up. A junction of three lines at menu size is a chevron; the eye's
## two lids close on its pupil; the grid's four cells shrink until the space between them
## is what you see. The rest scale honestly, because they were simple enough to.
