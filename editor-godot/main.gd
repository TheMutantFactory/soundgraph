## is legal, what is wrong with the graph, what a wire is carrying — is asked of the

## implementation is a second set of answers.
##

# The bar wants about 1600px to show everything and windows are not obliged to be that

# minimum size is a promise the container keeps, so the whole column was forced wider
# than the window and the inspector was pushed off the right-hand edge with its text cut
# through the middle. Nothing was hidden — it was drawn somewhere nobody could see it,
# which is the worst of both.
#
# So the bar gives things up deliberately, in an order decided here rather than by
# whichever control happened to be last. Each rung is a thing the bar can lose without
# losing what it is for, and every one of them stays reachable another way.
## Cheapest loss first, but "cheap" measured in what it costs the reader rather than in
## pixels — and then checked against the pixels, because a rung that buys nothing is a
## rung that makes the next one fire for no reason. Undo and redo come before the
## identity block on both counts: they are worth 140px to the bar against the product
## name's 65, and they are the only two controls here that keep working when they are

## at shutdown *after* the work succeeded — in roughly one run in five. That predates

## across that boundary can only have made it likelier, so the frames stop first.
## Stops the audio side and lets go of the engine.

## no frames pass between stopping the player and the engine being destroyed, and
## that gap is exactly what the crash needs. A caller that can await should call this
## first and give it a couple of frames.
##
## What is being avoided: AudioServer mixes on its own thread and holds a reference
## to the generator playback this fills every frame — a clean run leaks it with a
## reference count of 1, which is the audio server still having it. Destroy the

# Modules — stage 2 of docs/modules-design.md.
#
# An instance is one node with the module's declared surface. The editor's whole node
# pipeline — widgets, ports, the rack, the outline, the inspector — consumes registry
# descriptors, so an instance becomes ordinary by synthesizing a descriptor from its
# definition and registering it under "module:<name>". Everything downstream keys on
# _type_key(node) instead of the raw type and never learns anything else. The engine
# knows only the flattened graph, so the two places the editor talks to it about a
# *live* node — setting a parameter, reading a port — translate through the facade
# with _engine_parameter_target and _engine_signal_source.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Three things are in the registry that are not things you add. A module instance is made
## by collapsing a selection, not by picking a type. A per-node port shape (`seam:Input/@x`)
## describes a port that already exists. And the bare terminals — NoteInput, AudioInput,
## StereoOutput — are the older spelling of the port primitives: still loaded, still
## rendered, but offering both would put two ways to say the same thing side by side in the
## one place a person goes to learn the vocabulary.
##
## The terminal a search turns up is translated rather than dropped, so looking for
## "keyboard" still lands on something: the core ranks NoteInput, and what you get offered
## is the Input port bound to it.
