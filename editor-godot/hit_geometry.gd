## Routing goal 2.1: is the cable you can see the cable you can touch?
##
##   godot --headless --path editor-godot --script hit_geometry.gd
##
## Goal 2 found that `_connection_at` picked against `_route` while the editor draws
## catenaries, so on babble not one of twenty-six cables could be clicked at the point it is
## drawn. The contract this file enforces:
##
## > **A cable's interactive locus is the centreline actually displayed by the active cable
## > style.**
##
## Deliberately narrow. It proves the pointer and the picture agree, in both styles, at the
## zoom bands the editor uses. It does not measure the grab radius, redesign the hit area,
## or say anything about where the router chooses to go.
##
## Three assertions, and the third is the one that stops this being satisfied by a wider net:
##
##   1. a point on the displayed centreline selects that cable
##   2. at a crossing, the point selects the **upper** strand — the picture says one is on
##      top and the pointer has to agree
##   3. a point on the hidden routing path, further than the grab radius from anything
##      displayed, selects **nothing**

## Where along each cable to try, as a fraction of its arc length.
##
## The stub at each end is skipped, and the skipping is done here rather than assumed.
## `_connection_at` refuses any point within `STUB` of a port — those belong to the socket,
## and stealing the click there would make disconnecting impossible — so a sample that lands
## inside one is testing a rule that already exists. The first run of this file did not skip
## them and reported twenty-five failures on babble, every one of them a short cable whose
## 20% mark is inside its own stub. A probe that samples where the product declines to
## answer is measuring its own arithmetic.
