## How a node identity glyph is constructed.
##
## Step 9 drew three marks — an amplifier triangle, a filter response, an envelope contour
## — and they worked. This file is the difference between three marks that worked and a
## system that can produce the fiftieth one: the rules those three obey, written down as
## numbers a later drawing can be built from rather than as an impression a later drawing
## has to be judged against.
##
## Nothing here is a picture. The pictures are in `icons.gd`, which is where ink meets an
## image; this is the coordinate system, the shared levels, and the family plans they are
## drawn from. A new glyph should be constructible from this file and the family table
## below without inventing anything, and where it cannot be, that is the finding — the
## grammar is short a rule, and the rule goes here rather than into the drawing.
##
## ## The contract
##
## Every identity glyph obeys all eight. They are not preferences.
##
## 1. One cell. The mark lives in a square inside the node header, ANATOMY_GLYPH across,
##    reserved whether or not the type has a mark yet. A header does not grow to hold one
##    and a title does not start in a different place because one is missing.
## 2. One coordinate system. `middle` is the centre of the cell and `reach` is
##    `size * 0.28`. Every coordinate in every glyph is written as middle plus or minus a
##    multiple of reach, so a mark drawn at 96 and a mark drawn at 10 are the same drawing.
## 3. One field. FIELD reach units from the centre, and no further. The corners of the
##    cell are not drawing room — they are the air that keeps neighbouring marks from
##    touching and that keeps a mark from looking bigger than the word beside it.
## 4. One weight. `Icons.STROKE`, at every size, for every mark. A single stroke weight is
##    most of what makes a set look like a set.
## 5. An optical cut, not a smaller drawing. Below `Icons.OPTICAL_SIZE` a mark may be
##    drawn differently — fewer segments, larger terminals, an opened counter — but it may
##    not be drawn smaller and hoped about. The cut is a redraw for the space, the way a
##    type designer cuts a face for eight point.
## 6. Identity ink, never a signal colour. Marks are drawn in `Design.INK_SECOND`. The
##    cable colours mean signal type; a lowpass is not green because audio is green, and
##    the day a mark borrows a semantic colour is the day the semantic colours stop
##    meaning anything.
## 7. The mark yields to the name. When the title falls to the compensation overlay, the
##    glyph goes with it. Legibility of the name outranks the presence of the mark,
##    always, and no mark may push a title into its compact form.
## 7a. Identity is what the node *is*, and a very few types have more than one. A type may
##    declare **one** discrete parameter whose values change the operation it performs,
##    and choose a mark for each — a state-variable filter set to notch is not doing what
##    a lowpass does. `NodeIdentity.VARIANT` is the whole mechanism and it is deliberately
##    narrow: the general rule "a glyph may depend on a parameter" would let any moving
##    value drive identity, and identity would stop being identity. The name never
##    varies; only the mark and the control that sets it.
## 8. Behaviour, not hardware. A response curve rather than a filter; an amplifier symbol
##    rather than an amplifier. A drawing of equipment belongs in the rack, and this pass
##    has already had to walk back out of one.
## 9b. The open field is full, and a new concept that wants another curve has to prove
##    it. Fifteen of these marks are a line doing something across the same square —
##    waveforms, responses, contours, transfer functions — and by step 14F three
##    candidates in one batch failed against marks that were already there. A drawing
##    whose distinction from an existing one is a kink, a plateau, an extra peak or one
##    stroke is not a new mark. Reach instead for **enclosure, topology, an object
##    boundary, repeated structure or a spatial relationship** — the sample's brackets
##    and the operators' ring are both that — or reserve the cell.
## 9c. Empty is part of the vocabulary. A reserved cell is a finished state, not an
##    unfinished one: Phaser, Allpass, Clip, Abs and MinMax all ship without a mark and
##    look restrained rather than broken, because the cell is reserved either way and the
##    name is doing the work. Coverage is not the quality metric; honesty is. A mark that
##    is nearly right is worse than none, because it teaches the reader something untrue
##    and they have no way to find out.
## 9a. Repetition count is silhouette. How many times a shape repeats inside the field is
##    part of its outline, not a detail on it — two cycles of a sine and one cycle of a
##    sine are told apart instantly and neither is wearing a badge. This is what separates
##    an oscillator from an LFO, and it is true as well as convenient: one runs at audio
##    rate and the other does not. It should generalise to the temporal family, where a
##    clock, a pulse train and a delay are all the same idea at different densities.
## 9. Siblings differ in silhouette, not in a detail. A family is only useful if its
##    members are told apart as fast as the family is recognised, and at 24 pixels the
##    only thing that separates two marks is their outline. Mirroring is a silhouette;
##    inverting is a silhouette; removing one stroke is not. This rule is here because
##    the step 10 proof sheet found it the hard way, and `ROUTE_SWITCH` still fails it —
##    see `docs/node-glyph-grammar.md`.
##
## ## The families
##
## A family is a group of node types that share one drawing and differ by one
## transformation of it. That is what makes the set learnable: a reader who has met the
## lowpass has met the highpass, because the second is the first read the other way round,
## and nothing new had to be memorised.
##
## The grammar for each, semantically rather than as a list of pictures:
##
## [codeblock]
## Generators   waveform geometry — one cycle in the field
##              sine smooth, square cornered, saw ramped, noise unrepeating
## Filters      one response axis, two levels, transitions between them
##              lowpass falls, highpass rises, bandpass is a hill, notch is a valley
## Dynamics     amplitude transformed
##              gain the amplifier triangle, compressor a range converging,
##              limiter a signal meeting a ceiling
## Time         repetition along the horizontal
##              delay repeats, reverb repeats and decays, chorus displaces a copy
## Routing      terminals and the cords between them
##              split one to many, merge many to one, switch a selectable branch
## Control      the shape of a value over time
##              envelope the ADSR contour, LFO a slow wave, clock a pulse train,
##              sequencer discrete steps
## [/codeblock]
##
## Two of the six are drawn and proved — filters and routing, on the sheet
## `glyph_sheet.gd` renders. The other four are grammar only, on purpose: the point of
## this step was to show that families can be constructed, not to spend it drawing forty
## pictures nobody has asked for yet.
##
## ## What is deliberately not here
##
## Activity state. The Noun Project search behind step 9 turned up an envelope family
## (385861-385867) that draws the whole ADSR contour every time and solids only the
## segment being named, dashing the rest — identity kept, state added on top of it. It is
## the right idea and it is recorded in `docs/node-glyph-grammar.md`, not implemented,
## because a header mark that changes while the patch runs is interaction design and this
## file is meant to still be true afterwards.

## How far from the centre a mark may reach, in reach units. Read off the approved step 9
## specimens, which stand at 1.1 and 1.15 — the amplifier's leads are the widest thing in
## the set and they set the edge.
const FIELD := 1.15


# ---- the filter family ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# One axis, two levels and the transitions between them, which is how a response is drawn
# on paper and how it was drawn for the lowpass in step 9. Everything below is that
# specimen, generalised: the levels are its levels, the span is its span, and the knee is
# where its knee was.

## The two levels a response sits at. Amplitude is up, so the passband is the negative one
## — screen coordinates run down.
const PASS := -0.5
const STOP := 0.85

## The span the curve is drawn across. Not symmetric, and it was not in the specimen
## either: a response reads left to right and wants a little more room to arrive than to
## depart.
const LEFT := -1.1
const RIGHT := 1.05

## Where the shoulder of a transition sits, as fractions measured from the passband end:
## along the transition in x, and toward the stop level in y.
##
## The knee belongs to the passband. A real filter leaves its passband gently and arrives
## at its stopband steeply, and because the level fraction (0.44) is under the along
## fraction (0.55) that is exactly what this draws — the curve hangs above its own chord.
## Anchoring at the pass end rather than at the left end is what makes the rule survive
## mirroring: the highpass gets the same gentle departure, on the other side.
##
## Read off the step 9 lowpass, whose shoulder was placed by hand at 0.547 and 0.444.
const KNEE_ALONG := 0.55
const KNEE_LEVEL := 0.44

## The four responses, as level plans: a list of [x, level] breakpoints in reach units,
## always in ascending x. Consecutive points at one level are a flat run; points at
## different levels are a transition, and polyline() puts the shoulder in.
##
## The lowpass is the step 9 specimen unchanged. The highpass is it mirrored. The bandpass
## and the notch are the same two levels with a plateau in the middle, at one width, so
## that the pair reads as one shape and its inverse rather than as two drawings.

const RESPONSE_NOTCH := [[LEFT, PASS], [-0.18, STOP], [0.18, STOP], [RIGHT, PASS]]


# ---- the control family ---------------------------------------------------------------

## The ADSR contour, as the four segments it is made of: attack, decay, sustain, release.
##
## Five points and four segments, which is the whole reason this is written down rather
## than drawn inline — the segments are named things, and a mark that wants to say which
## one is running needs to be able to ask for the third one by number.
##
## The peak is left of centre and the sustain is a plateau above the baseline, which is
## what separates this from the bandpass's symmetric arch. They are the closest pair in
## the set and the asymmetry is the whole of the difference.

## A level plan expanded into the polyline to stroke, in reach units from the centre.
##
## The small cut is rule 5 doing its work: below the optical size a transition is one
## straight ramp. The shoulder of a curve is a pixel and a half at header size and reads
## as a kink rather than as a corner, so at that size it is not drawn at all. Direction is
## the whole message down there, and direction is what survives.

## One cycle of a sawtooth, as the generator family draws a waveform: the shape the node
## actually makes, in the field, at the field's own width.
##
## A saw and not a sine because this type is a `SawOscillator`. That is the generator
## family's whole rule — the mark is the waveform — and it is what keeps the oscillator
## and the modulator apart without either of them wearing a distinguishing decoration.
## The corpus agrees: every sawtooth in the Noun Project's signal-processing collections
## is this drawing.

## How many cycles a generator's waveform is drawn with, against the one a control mark
## gets.
##
## This is the rule that keeps a sine oscillator apart from an LFO, and it is the first
## thing the rollout demanded that the three specimens had not already taught. Both marks
## are a sine; what differs is that a generator's waveform *repeats* and a modulation is
## one slow excursion. Two ripples against one broad curve is a silhouette — the shape's
## own frequency — rather than a badge stuck on one of them.
##
## It is also true rather than decorative: an oscillator runs at audio rate and an LFO
## does not, and the marks say exactly that.
const GENERATOR_CYCLES := 2.0
const CONTROL_CYCLES := 1.0

## A slow modulation, as one large smooth cycle.
##
## The control family's mark for a thing that moves other things. Angular against smooth
## is what separates it from the oscillator, and that is a silhouette rather than a
## detail — rule 9 — which is also where the corpus landed on its own: every icon filed
## under "modulation" is a sinuous curve and every one under "sawtooth" is a ramp.
##
## Sampled rather than arced so the two ends leave the field horizontally, the way a wave

## standing off a centre line rather than joined into a run.
##
## Joined up they are a zigzag, and at header size a zigzag is the sine's ripple — the two
## were indistinguishable on the first proof sheet. Bars say the thing that actually
## separates noise from every other waveform, which is that no two excursions are alike
## and none of them follows from the last.
##
## Written down rather than generated: a glyph that is different every time it is drawn is
## not a glyph. Six at full size and four at header size, because six bars inside fifteen

# ---- the temporal family --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Everything here is a value over time, which is also what the envelope and the modulation
# wave are. What separates the members is **density and regularity**, not decoration:
#
#   repeated smooth cycles     a generator, running at audio rate
#   one broad cycle            a modulator, running under it
#   repeated equal pulses      a clock: regular, discrete, and it only says when
#   unequal bars               noise: no two alike and none following from the last
#   a joined staircase         sample and hold: a continuous signal held between samples
#   separated blocks           a sequencer: a list of discrete values, not a signal
#   one diagonal               a slide: the whole mark is the transition
#   one flat line              a constant: the value that does not change
#
# Two devices do most of the work and both are honest. **Regular against irregular** tells
# a clock from noise and a sequencer from a sample-and-hold. **Joined against separated**
# tells a held signal from a list of values, which is exactly the difference between them.

## And at header size a pulse is one upright rather than a narrow box. Sixteen hundredths
## of a reach is two pixels there, which is the stroke weight — so the pulse's two edges
## and its top filled into a block, and three blocks on a line read as a square wave. A
## baseline with uprights standing on it is what a clock reduces to, and it keeps the one
## thing that separates it from every other rectangular mark in the set: the baseline.

## A comb's response: the notch, repeated. And a formant's: the bandpass peak, repeated.
##
## Neither is a new family. A comb filter puts periodic notches in a spectrum and a

## They are also each other's inverse, the way the notch and the bandpass are: dips in a

## not. That is the same pair of shapes the filter family already trades in, which is the

# ---- the maths family -----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Where the corpus rollout stops being able to borrow. These four are transfer functions —
# what comes out for what goes in — and a transfer function is a real drawing rather than a
# symbol, which is what keeps them clear of the chrome. A bare mathematical sign at
# twenty-four pixels is an application command; a curve is not.
#
# The one place notation survives is inside a ring, which Add and Multiply established and
# which is not extended here: there is no Subtract, Divide or Negate type in the registry
# to extend it with.

## Clip: the transfer curve of a bounded signal. Flat at the floor, straight through the
## middle, flat at the ceiling.
##
## Corner to corner on purpose. The highpass response is also flat-rise-flat and the
## difference is where the flats sit: a response moves between two bands a third of the
## field apart, and a clip runs the whole diagonal of it.

## And the second attempt: the *output* rather than the transfer function. A wave with its
## peaks flattened is what clipping looks like on a scope, and it is in the waveform family
## rather than the response family — which is the collision the transfer curve could not
## get out of, because flat-ramp-flat is also the highpass.

## is what full-wave rectification actually looks like on a scope.

## the mode changes the operation.

# ---- the combining family -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# What happens where signals meet. The signal-flow conventions, which are a family already
# and have been since somebody first drew a block diagram: a ring with a cross in it is a
# multiplier and a ring with a plus in it is a summing junction. Same ring, different
# content, and nothing else in the set is a ring with something inside it.
#
# Drawn rather than borrowed from the icon set's existing cross, which is a dismiss
# button: a node wearing the same mark as a close control is a node somebody will try to
# close.

## The ring, and how far the mark inside it reaches. The content is kept well clear of the
## ring so that at header size the two do not weld into a filled disc.

## Dropping the ring was tried first and it was wrong for one specific reason: a bare
## cross at twenty-four pixels is the dismiss button, stroke for stroke, and a node
## wearing a close control is a node somebody will try to close. The ring is the part
## that says diagram rather than interface, so the ring is the part that cannot go.

# ---- the routing family --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Terminals and the cords between them, which is what the reader is already looking at:
# the graph itself is discs on the perimeter of boxes with lines between them, and a
# routing mark is that picture at glyph size. Nothing else in the icon set is made of
# discs joined by strokes, so the family is legible as a family before any one of its
# members is read.

## The fan is two discs and the trunk is one, so the mark balances by giving the heavier
## end less room.
const JUNCTION_X := 0.08

## Below the optical size the terminals grow and the cords shorten. The nodes have to be
## the biggest thing in the mark for the mark to be about nodes — the rail's split glyph
## learned this the hard way, where keeping the large span gave the ports two pixels each
## and produced a chevron with a dot on it.
