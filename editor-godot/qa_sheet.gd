## Step 15B: the whole language at once, in a graph built to make it fail.
##
## Every proof before this one looked at a part — a glyph beside its neighbours, a node
## in eight states, one type forced to six widths. They all passed, and that is exactly
## the reason for this one: a system can hold at every seam and still not read as a
## system. What has never been asked is whether thirty nodes drawn by these rules, packed
## close enough to interfere with each other, still say *source, modulation,
## transformation, combination, output* before anybody reads a label.
##
## So the specimen is deliberately hostile. `qa/dense-graph.json` is not a musical patch
## and is not arranged to flatter anything: all six width classes, every glyph family,
## three reserved identity cells, a node the validator genuinely complains about, a
## twenty-four character name beside a one-character one, four inputs into one mixer and
## that mixer into another, two fan-outs, and several cables crossing the whole graph
## because their ends are at opposite corners.
##
##   godot --path editor-godot --script qa_sheet.gd
##
## with QA_SHEET_OUT naming a directory. Not headless: it captures pixels.
##
## ## What it does that a screenshot cannot
##
## The pictures are for the ten questions, which are perceptual and are answered by a
## person. Everything a machine can settle is settled here instead, over the **whole**
## matrix rather than the representative corner the pictures come from: five palettes by
## four interface scales by four zooms is eighty frames, and the checks below run on all
## of them.
##
##   - no migrated title is ever cut to an ellipsis, at any zoom or scale
##   - every node stands at its declared width class, to the pixel
##   - nothing in any node is clipped, overlapping, or outside its own frame
##   - the alert mark appears on exactly the nodes the validator complained about
##   - a node with a reserved identity cell draws no glyph and keeps its title column
##   - the detail band actually falls as the zoom does, and nothing survives it that
##     `NodeOptical` says should not

## another dark theme with different accents.
