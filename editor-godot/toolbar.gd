## The editor's top row, extracted whole from main.gd once its rework settled.
##
## It owns what a top row is: the identity block and its QR, the one verb, undo and
## redo, the message gap, the transport dot, the hamburger, and the responsive ladder
## that decides what a narrow window costs. It does not own what any of it *does* —
## every action leaves through a signal, and main wires them to the handlers it always
## had. The split line is the same one the architecture draws everywhere else: this
## file knows how the bar looks and folds, main knows what the program means.
##
## The popups (view, arrange, the menu itself) stay reachable as members because main
## legitimately updates their check states as the document changes; that is state
## display, not action handling, and mirroring it through signals would be ceremony.
