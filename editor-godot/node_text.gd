class_name NodeText
extends RefCounted

## The typography inside a graph node, as roles rather than as overrides.
##
## Six kinds of text live on a node and they were being styled where they were built,
## which is how two of them ended up identical: a parameter's name and a port's name were
## both medium weight, body size, normal ink. On the Amplifier that produces the word
## "gain" twice in the same node at the same rank, once beside a socket and once under a
## knob, with nothing in the type to say they are different kinds of thing.
##
## The ranking this file exists to make true, reading down:
##
##   node name      identity        bright, semibold, larger
##   value          what it is at   bright, tabular figures, the loudest thing inside
##   unit           what it is in   the value's family, one size and one shade down
##   parameter name what it is      secondary ink, medium, subordinate to its value
##   port name      what connects   secondary ink a shade quieter, regular weight
##
## A reader scanning a patch wants the values; the names are how you check you are reading
## the right one. That is the order, and before this every one of them was fighting for
## the same rank.
##
## Applied to `NodeIdentity.MIGRATED` only while the pass is being reviewed.

enum Role {
	NODE_TITLE,      ## the name in the header — step 3 set this and it is unchanged
	PARAM_LABEL,     ## the word under a control
	PARAM_VALUE,     ## the number
	PARAM_UNIT,      ## Hz, ms, octaves/s

## Dresses one label in its role. Everything a role decides — face, size, colour — is
## decided here, so a rank can be changed in one place rather than in six.

			# and every value went missing from the node. Rank here is carried by weight
