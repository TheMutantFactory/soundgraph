extends RefCounted

## One thing the Add Node browser can show, whatever it came from.
##
## Before this, the browser was handed dictionaries that still smelled of where they were
## found: a node carried the core's category, a device carried the prefix on its label,
## and the browser worked out what to do with each as it drew them. That works for two
## sources and stops working at four — the place where the old shapes leak back in is the
## preview pane, which is the next thing being built, so the leak is closed first.
##
## The rule this file exists to hold: `kind` says what the thing is, `category` says where
## the browser puts it. They are different questions and were one field. A bank voice and
## a worked patch are both patches to load; they belong in different rows of the rail. A
## node and a bank voice both drop into the graph as a node; they are not the same kind of
## object at all.
##
## What is deliberately absent: author, rating, complexity, cloud id, and every other
## field a preview mockup might one day want. Fields arrive when something reads them.

## What the object is.

}

## honouring them, and until then Enter takes the one route the search palette takes.

## delay line is an effect, and should not have to.

## Whether a query finds this.
##
## One question with two answers behind it. A node is decided by the core's own ranking —
## `ranked` is the set it returned, so "make quieter" finds the same node in the browser
## as on the command line, and the browser does not pretend to know better. Anything else
## is decided here, on every word of the query appearing in the name.
##
## Normalising did not mean throwing the specialised ranking away. It meant the browser
## gets one vocabulary back from both.

## What the preview pane shows under the description: a heading and its lines, in the
## order they should be read.
##
## Here rather than in the pane. The pane draws headings and lines and knows nothing about
## nodes or banks, which is the whole point of the step before this one — the alternative
## is a preview pane that grows a branch per kind, which is where the provider shapes were
## always going to leak back in.
##
## `facts` is what only the editor can answer: how many nodes a patch has, what it plays
## through. It is fetched when a patch is actually looked at, because three hundred patch
## files are not read to draw a list.
