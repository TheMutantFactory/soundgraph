extends Node
## Plays SoundGraph patches as game sound effects.
##
## This is the file to copy into a Godot project. It is deliberately short, because the
## point is how little there is: a patch is a JSON file, an engine renders it, and a game
## event fires it. There is no build step, no import, and no baked audio.
##
##     var sounds := GameSounds.new()
##     add_child(sounds)
##     sounds.load_folder("res://sounds")     # every .json in the folder
##     ...
##     sounds.play("jump")
##
## Why a patch rather than a .wav. A wav is one recording of one sound. A patch is the
## instructions, so it can be changed while the game runs — which is the whole argument
## for this project, and the sandbox next door exists to let somebody try it: edit the
## graph, hear the jump change, without leaving the editor.
##
## Each sound gets its own engine and its own player, and `play` retriggers rather than
## overlapping. Two coins collected in the same frame make one coin sound, not two. That is
## usually what a game wants and it keeps this file readable; real polyphony is a pool of
## voices per sound, which is a different and longer file.

## Emitted when a patch fails to load, with the diagnostics the core produced. Sound is the
## thing nobody notices is broken, so this does not fail quietly.

## Fires a sound from the beginning.
##
## The patches are triggered by a NoteInput, so firing one is playing a note — which is
## also what makes them usable as modules and playable in the editor.
##
## This used to release the note first, because an AHD envelope triggers on a rising edge
## and a key already held gives it none. That worked most of the time, which is worse than
## not working: control events are drained at block boundaries, so a release and a press in
## the same frame produce no sample where the gate is low, and the envelope sees a gate
## that never moved. A double jump fired one sound instead of two, sometimes, depending on
## where the block edges fell. The patches now take NoteInput's `trigger` output, which
## pulses on every note whether or not one is held, so the release is gone and so is the
## intermittency.
##
## The pitch is ignored by these patches, which take only the trigger; a coin has a pitch
## of its own. Passing one anyway means a patch that *does* use the frequency will follow
## it, which is how a game would want to play a footstep at different pitches.

## round-trip check began failing about one run in three with status 0xC0000005, a crash
## during shutdown, long after the work had succeeded.
## Every voice down, deliberately: stopped and unplugged under one audio lock so the
## mixer cannot be mid-block in any of them, then freed by hand rather than left to
## the tree's own ordering — which frees children on its schedule, not this one, and
## was the last place the shutdown crash could still stand.

	# merely stopped still has one attached for it to be inside. This released
