## Graphrack — the same patch, drawn as a Eurorack case.
##
## This is a *view*, not a second editor. It reads the same document, the same registry
## descriptors and the same layering as the graph view, and writes parameter changes back
## through the same path. Nothing here knows anything about audio that the core has not
## published, and there is no second copy of the node vocabulary: a module's knobs and
## jacks are whatever the descriptor says the node has.
##
## Why it exists: a signal-flow graph is the honest picture, but a rack is the picture
## musicians already know how to read, and it is the one that stops people walking past a
## stand. Both are true at once, so both are drawn, and which one leads at Knobcon is a
## question to answer by watching people rather than by arguing.
##
## Layout is deliberately not free-form. Modules are ordered by the layering the graph view
## already computed — signal flows left to right — and then flowed into rack rows. A real
## case has no coordinates either; you slide modules along a rail.

## two rows of jacks, and a per-density allowance for the space between them.

	## panel that only holds knobs is a picture of hardware rather than an instrument,
	## and the blank middle of these modules was the clearest evidence of it.

	## seventh of a cycle, so a sawtooth drew as a straight diagonal and every display
