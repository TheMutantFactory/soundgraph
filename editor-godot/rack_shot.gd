## Every sheet so far has drawn cables against a mock panel 250 px wide with four jacks
## crammed into 208 of them. Whether the plug is correctly restrained or still too small
## is a question about actual module widths and actual jack spacing, and a mock cannot
## answer it — which is why the plan says stop making sheets and go and look.
