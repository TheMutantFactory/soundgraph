extends GraphEdit
## The graph canvas: PCB-style cable routing and draggable wires.
##
## A curved cable that passes straight through a node is unreadable — you cannot tell
## where it goes or what it is connected to. So a cable is drawn as a smooth curve while
## its path is clear, and switches to a routed orthogonal trace, with 45-degree corners,
## when it would otherwise cross something. That is the same reason PCB traces look the
## way they do: legibility around obstacles.
##
## When the router's choice is still not what the user wants, they can drag the cable
## itself. The drag creates a waypoint the route must pass through, stored in the patch
## alongside the node positions, so it survives save and load like any other layout.
##
## Coordinate spaces are the subtle part here, so they are named explicitly:
##   graph space  — what position_offset and get_*_port_position use; what patches store
##   line space   — what _get_connection_line receives and returns: graph space * zoom
##   local space  — mouse events: graph space * zoom - scroll_offset

# multiple of it, which leaves you counting minor lines to find the one you want to align

# half-major is a row. The line you align to is the line the layout uses, so there is
# nothing to count.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Set GraphEdit's own show_grid to false and let this draw instead; the two would
## otherwise overlay two unrelated sets of major lines.
## Matches Rack.CableStyle. The graph view honours the same choice so the two views can be

#
# While you are reading a node it should be almost gone: at 0.22 the major lines were

## How much of a node is worth drawing at the current zoom.
##
## Zooming out of a patcher normally just makes everything smaller, so at the point where
## you can finally see the whole graph none of it is readable and the view is useless for
## the one thing it is good for — seeing the shape of the thing.
##
## A map is the model, not a photograph. Zooming out of a map does not shrink the word
## "Chicago" until it is a smudge; the representation changes, and the words that survive
## stay readable. So each band is a different *drawing* of a node rather than the same
## drawing at a smaller size, and the words that survive are pinned to screen-space
## minimums by ScreenText below.
##
##   FULL      everything, edited in place
##   COMPACT   the words and the numbers; the sliders give up their room to the words
##   SUMMARY   identity, ports and port names — no control panel
##   TOPOLOGY  identity and wiring, which is all anyone is reading at this size
##
## The thresholds have hysteresis. Without it a zoom sitting exactly on a boundary makes
## every node in the graph flicker between two layouts as the mouse wheel jitters.
enum Detail { FULL, COMPACT, SUMMARY, TOPOLOGY }

## The full-detail boundary is derived, not chosen: it is the zoom at which a parameter
## value stops being legible on its own, so it is also the zoom at which the node stops
## being a control panel that can be read without help. The old hand-picked 0.68 let a
## 16px value shrink to 10.9 rendered pixels while the design system elsewhere promised
## nothing operational below 14 — the floor stopped at the canvas edge, and the canvas is
## where the most-read text in the application lives.
##
## Below here the words do not shrink and are not dropped: ScreenText draws them at their
## own minimum instead. What the boundary marks is the end of *editing in place* — the
## point past which the controls are too small to aim at and their room is better spent
## on the words that say what they are.

## Where the control panel stops being worth drawing, and where the node stops being a
## panel at all. Unlike the FULL boundary these are not derivable from the type scale —
## below FULL the words are screen-space pinned and stay legible at any zoom, so what
## ends each band is *room*, not legibility: at 0.60 a compensated label has stopped
## fitting beside a compensated value, and at 0.40 the node is too small to hold a row
## of text at all without the words spilling over their own node.
## Zoom must clear a boundary by this much before detail comes *back*, so a wheel click
## resting on a threshold does not flicker every node in the graph between two layouts.
const DETAIL_HYSTERESIS := 0.02

## The bands are one hysteresis *below* the numbers they are meant to honour — 0.60 for
## compact and 0.40 for summary — so those numbers hold whichever direction you arrive
## from. They did not before, and the bug only ever showed up in a picture: the editor
## opens fitted, which is often under 0.60, so zooming *up* to 63% asked the hysteresis
## to climb and it refused until 64%. A screenshot at 63% was therefore a summary node,
## empty where its parameters should have been, while the same view reached by zooming
## down from 100% was correct. A boundary that depends on which way you came is a
## boundary nobody can state.

## …and they move with the UI-scale preference, because what ends these bands is room.
##
## A node keeps its size in graph space, so the room a row has on screen is its width
## times the zoom — while the text that has to fit in it is pinned to a screen size that
## *rises* with the reader's preference. At XL the floor is 20px in a node 217px wide at
## 63%, and the matrix showed exactly what that produces: "out" and "in" from neighbouring
## nodes collided into "oiuln", a value ran into the next node's label, and the compact
## band was drawing a control panel in a space that could not hold one.
##
## The brief's own answer, and the right one: when compensation would overcrowd, change
## the level of detail rather than allow the overlap. So a reader on XL reaches summary
## and topology sooner — the same information, one representation earlier, which is what
## asking for larger text on a smaller canvas actually costs.

## the marker looks and well under anything aimable. Counter-scaled below so what the
## pointer has to hit stays the size the design system asked for however far out the
## canvas is — geometry may shrink, and the things a hand has to land on may not.
##
