## The graph canvas: PCB-style cable routing and draggable wires.
##
## A curved cable that passes straight through a node is unreadable — you cannot tell
## where it goes or what it is connected to. So a cable is drawn as a smooth curve while
## its path is clear, and switches to a routed orthogonal trace, with 45-degree corners,
## when it would otherwise cross something. That is the same reason PCB traces look the
## way they do: legibility around obstacles.
##
## When the router's choice is still not what the user wants, they can drag the cable
## itself. The drag creates a waypoint the route must pass through, stored in the patch
## alongside the node positions, so it survives save and load like any other layout.
##
## Coordinate spaces are the subtle part here, so they are named explicitly:
##   graph space  — what position_offset and get_*_port_position use; what patches store
##   line space   — what _get_connection_line receives and returns: graph space * zoom
##   local space  — mouse events: graph space * zoom - scroll_offset

## How much of a node is worth drawing at the current zoom.
##
## Zooming out of a patcher normally just makes everything smaller, so at the point where
## you can finally see the whole graph none of it is readable and the view is useless for

##
## A map is the model, not a photograph. Zooming out of a map does not shrink the word
## "Chicago" until it is a smudge; the representation changes, and the words that survive
## stay readable. So each band is a different *drawing* of a node rather than the same
## drawing at a smaller size, and the words that survive are pinned to screen-space
## minimums by ScreenText below.
##
##   FULL      everything, edited in place
##   COMPACT   the words and the numbers; the sliders give up their room to the words
##   SUMMARY   identity, ports and port names — no control panel
##   TOPOLOGY  identity and wiring, which is all anyone is reading at this size
##
## The thresholds have hysteresis. Without it a zoom sitting exactly on a boundary makes
## every node in the graph flicker between two layouts as the mouse wheel jitters.

## being a control panel that can be read without help. The old hand-picked 0.68 let a
## 16px value shrink to 10.9 rendered pixels while the design system elsewhere promised
## nothing operational below 14 — the floor stopped at the canvas edge, and the canvas is
## where the most-read text in the application lives.
##
## Below here the words do not shrink and are not dropped: ScreenText draws them at their
## own minimum instead. What the boundary marks is the end of *editing in place* — the
## point past which the controls are too small to aim at and their room is better spent
## on the words that say what they are.

## fitting beside a compensated value, and at 0.40 the node is too small to hold a row
## of text at all without the words spilling over their own node.

## opens fitted, which is often under 0.60, so zooming *up* to 63% asked the hysteresis
## to climb and it refused until 64%. A screenshot at 63% was therefore a summary node,
## empty where its parameters should have been, while the same view reached by zooming

## *rises* with the reader's preference. At XL the floor is 20px in a node 217px wide at
## 63%, and the matrix showed exactly what that produces: "out" and "in" from neighbouring
## nodes collided into "oiuln", a value ran into the next node's label, and the compact
## band was drawing a control panel in a space that could not hold one.
##
## The brief's own answer, and the right one: when compensation would overcrowd, change
## the level of detail rather than allow the overlap. So a reader on XL reaches summary
## and topology sooner — the same information, one representation earlier, which is what
## asking for larger text on a smaller canvas actually costs.

## stubs, and two horizontal ones filtered by nothing at all. Goal 3A measured what that
## costs: on the hostile fixtures **eighty per cent of every cable's candidate channels are

##
## which is the legalizer's shape, for the same reason it worked there.

## parameter label arrives as 10.4 real pixels — the stylesheet still says 16 and the
## reader still cannot read it. Checking the declared size proves nothing here; what
## matters is what lands on the glass.
##
## Counter-scaling the labels in place was tried first and the port test refused it,
## correctly: a bigger label makes a taller row, which moves every port under it, and a
## node's geometry must not depend on how far out somebody is standing. Cables would
## crawl as you zoomed. So the words move *up* here instead — drawn over the graph
## without being part of it, at their own minimum, at the place their label sits. While
## a label is being drawn up here its real one is made transparent rather than hidden,
## because hiding it would collapse the row and change the very geometry this exists to
## protect.
##
## Any Label carrying a `screen_min` meta joins in, so marking a new piece of node text
## as operational is one line at the place it is built rather than a case in here.
## The graph's cables, drawn as cords.

## GraphEdit draws its own connections as thin flat lines, which was the right grammar
## when the rack's cables were thin flat lines too. They are cords now — a material
## stack of shadow, dark same-hue edge, saturated body and same-hue highlight — and a
## patch that changes weight when you change lenses reads as two patches. This layer
## draws the same stack along the exact geometry GraphEdit routes: the same
## _get_connection_line, so catenary, PCB lanes and dragged waypoints all keep working,
## and the native thin line is simply painted over by the cord that follows it.
##
## Under the nodes, like the native lines: a cable on this canvas passes behind the

	## A parameter cell is one thing, so it is allocated as one thing **and removed as one
	## thing**.
	##
	## Drawn independently, the name and the value competed for the same row: the value's
	## box expands to fill what the hidden slider left, so the name was pushed back to its
	## own 96px and "resonance" at its minimum no longer fitted — the label vanished and

	## against the right, both at their own minimum.

	## That fixed the allocation and left the removal, which step 15B measured and found
	## still broken. When the pair genuinely would not fit, this drew whichever half it
	## could and let the other fall through to the generic pass, which then decided it on
	## its own — and the reader got `cutoff` with no number, or a bare `4` with no word.
	## Twenty-eight of ninety-seven cells at Compact and thirteen at Comfortable, in both
	## directions, across nine node types.
	##
	## The old comment here defended a priority — "the value goes, because a name with no

	## the pair is known to fit. `handled` is what keeps the generic pass from resurrecting
	## a half that this one decided against — a label left unhandled is a label the generic
	## pass gets an independent opinion about, which is precisely how the orphans arrived.
