## The one place the editor's surfaces, type, spacing and colour are decided.
##
## Before this there was no system: a font size here, a hardcoded grey there, and the
## result was exactly what you would expect — application chrome, node headers, node
## bodies, canvas and inspector all landing within a few percent of the same lightness,
## and almost every label at the same weight. Everything was legible and nothing was
## ranked, so the eye had nowhere to start.
##
## Four rules, applied everywhere:
##
##   1. Depth is lightness. Four surface levels — canvas, node, raised, active — each a
##      clear step up, with a border that steps with it. Colour is for *meaning* (signal
##      type, error, accent), never for hierarchy.
##   2. Spacing comes from a scale. 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, and nothing in between. Half the
##      "crowded" feeling in a UI is twelve slightly different paddings.
##   3. Hierarchy is weight and size, in that order. Secondary information gets a lighter
##      weight and a calmer colour before it gets made smaller, because unimportant and
##      unreadable are not the same thing.
##   4. Contrast has a floor, and it is tested. See design_test.gd — every text-on-surface
##      pairing this file defines is checked against WCAG, and primary text is held to the
##      enhanced 7:1 rather than the 4.5:1 minimum. A dense tool people stare at for hours
##      should not be designed right against the line.
##
## Atkinson Hyperlegible Next is the family throughout. It ships as a single variable font
## with a 200–800 weight axis, so Regular, Medium and SemiBold all come from one file.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Palettes
#
# Components do not know colours. They ask for a token — canvas, panel, text, audio,
# trigger — and a palette decides what that means. The point is not skinning: it is that
# "audio signal" stays one idea with one name however the editor looks, so a theme can
# change everything about the appearance without changing what anything *means*.
#
# What deliberately does not move between palettes is the semantic mapping. Mint is audio,
# blue is control, amber is gate and trigger, in every one of them. A palette adjusts
# luminance and saturation to keep its contrast, but somebody switching themes should not
# have to relearn the patch language — and Paper does exactly that, using dark signal
# colours instead of the bright ones, because the dark-theme mint would vanish on white.
#
# Every pairing below is checked by design_test.gd against thresholds deliberately above
# the WCAG minimums: 7:1 for operating text where AA asks 4.5, 4.5:1 for semantic coloured
# text, and 3.25:1 for the boundaries of controls where AA asks 3. Designing exactly at a
# cutoff leaves nothing for a bad screen or a bright room to take away.

# spending a signal-type colour (amber is triggers) on a UI state would be worse than
# the ambiguity it fixed.

## How far something is asked to stand down, named rather than numbered.

## that down" gives a different answer on every palette — a fixed 45% mix put mint at
## 4.2:1 on Lab and 2.5:1 on Paper Lab, one inside the readable range and one under it.
## Stated as a contrast floor it gives the same legibility everywhere and takes whatever
## mixing that needs, which is what makes it survive a theme change.
##
## The order is how directly the thing was asked about, not how important it is:
##
##   ASIDE     one of a handful that belong to what is selected, and the rest stand down
##   TRACE     one thing in particular was asked about, and this is not it
##   BEHIND    something is being read through this, and this is in the way
##   GHOST     the question is not about this kind of thing at all, for as long as a key
##             is held — under the floor a UI boundary is held to, deliberately
##
## Anything with a resting state and a de-emphasised one should use these rather than
## inventing an alpha: secondary labels, inactive modulation overlays, unfocused modules,
## disabled controls. Pass one to recede().
const STAND_DOWN := {
	"ASIDE": 3.6,
	"TRACE": 2.4,

## leaves a colour that starts below it at full saturation, which on a pale faceplate is
## how the quietest cable on the rack ended up the loudest thing on it.

## For de-emphasis — a rack cable that has nothing to do with the selected module, and
## anything else that should fall behind without leaving. Mixes toward the surface rather
## than fading to transparent, which is not the same thing: transparency assumes what is
## behind is dark, and on Paper Lab a receding colour has to get *lighter*.
##
## The amount of mixing is found rather than fixed, because how much a colour can give up
## depends on how much it had. A fixed 45% put mint at 4.2:1 on Lab and 2.5:1 on Paper —
## the same instruction, one result inside the floor and one under it. Asking for a target
## contrast instead gives the same legibility on every palette and takes whatever mixing
## that happens to need.
##
## A colour already at or below the target is returned untouched. There is nothing to take.
## `least` is a mix that happens whatever the contrast says.
##
## Because a contrast floor on its own assumes that receding always has somewhere to go,
## and a colour already below the floor is returned untouched — which is right when the
## question is legibility and wrong when the question is emphasis. Chartreuse on an ivory
## faceplate starts below the floor, so a cable asked to get out of the way came back at
## full saturation: quiet by the numbers and the loudest thing on the panel. Standing down
## is two instructions, not one. No quieter than this, and no more saturated than this.
