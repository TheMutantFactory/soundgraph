## What a parameter actually says to the reader at each distance.
##
## 15B's screenshots showed nodes at 66% reading `cutoff` with no number beside it and a
## bare `0.42` with no word beside it, and a screenshot cannot tell you whether that is a
## rendering artefact, a crop, or the system. This asks the renderer.
##
## `ScreenText.fit_for` is the whole screen-space typography decision in one function, and
## the file that holds it says why anything else is worthless: a test that reasons about
## font sizes on its own is a second implementation that can agree with the stylesheet
## while the screen disagrees with both. So every label here is put to that function, and
## what comes back is what the reader receives.

## a cell whose two halves cross their own thresholds one frame apart — the name reaching
## at 0.876 and the value not until 0.874 — and the only place to catch that is either side
## of the edge.
