##
## A seam bound to a host is where the graph meets the machine — the keyboard, the
## speakers. Drawn as a node in the middle of the graph it was a node like any other, and
## it is not: you cannot move it somewhere else, there is only ever one of it, and what is
## on the far side of it is not in the file at all. So it goes where the machine is. The
## keyboard's jacks sit on the keyboard, the output's beside it, and the cables run from
## there up into the patch.
##
## The cables are the reason this is not simply a layout change. GraphEdit draws
## connections between its own children and nothing else, so a cable from the dock into the
## graph has nobody to draw it. `Cables` below is that nobody: one Control over the whole
## window, computing both ends in viewport space, clipped to the graph's own rectangle so a
## cable cannot paint over the toolbar it passes behind.

## A row of sockets for one seam's ports, with their names under them.
