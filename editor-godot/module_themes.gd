# What a module looks like.
#
# Not what it does: every theme here changes faceplate, knobs, jack rings and cable
# colours and nothing else. The geometry is shared, so a Filter is the same shape and the
# same size whatever it is wearing, and a patch means exactly what it meant before
# somebody repainted it.
#
# One theme is not in the list. "Category" is the default and is what this editor has
# always drawn: one graphite panel for every module, with a two-pixel stripe under the
# title in the colour of what the module is. It stays the default because that stripe
# means something and a repaint does not.
#
# Every theme is checked by design_test.gd for the same thing the palettes are: that the
# legend on the faceplate can be read. A mustard panel with white lettering looks lovely
# in a mock-up and is unreadable on a laptop in a bright room.

## The one that means something. Faceplate comes from the module's category, so the rack
## stays readable at a glance; everything else follows the editor palette.
const CATEGORY := "category"


## Each theme is a flat token set, written out rather than derived.
##
## `faceplate` is the panel and `highlight` is the same plate catching the light along
## its top edge; `edge` is the sidewall it is mounted in. `legend` is the lettering and
## must contrast with the plate; `muted` is the same ink printed thinner, for rules and
## tick marks rather than for words — on Safety Orange it is 3.9:1 and no word may be set
## in it. `hardware` and `hardware_hi` are the moulded black of a knob body and the light
## on its top face, which is family DNA rather than a per-theme decision: every board in
## the reference set has black knobs. `accent` is the theme's one functional colour — an
## index ring, an active state — and is not sprinkled about. `knob` and `pointer` are the
## body and the index mark. `jack` is the socket field — black in every one of these,
## which is the family resemblance — and `ring` is the colour around it.
##
## `cables` is the candy, and it is four colours because there are four kinds of signal.
## They are handed to audio, control, trigger and note in that order rather than being
## sprinkled about: a theme is allowed to change what the signal language looks like, and
## not allowed to abolish it. Following a cable by its colour has to keep working, or the
## rack has stopped being a diagram and become a poster.
