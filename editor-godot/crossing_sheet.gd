## Cable pass, goal 1: can a reader tell which strand continues through a crossing?
##
## Only where it is actually hard. The baseline found zero shallow crossings in the hostile
## patch — the per-cable hang and the departure splay have already made every intersection
## transverse — and fifteen of the thirty-two are between cables of the **same colour**.
## Two identical mint strands meeting at a perfectly readable angle is the whole defect, so
## that is the whole of what this sheet photographs.
##
## Four columns, three of them candidates:
##
## [codeblock]
## NONE       nothing at all — the reference, so the sheet shows what a treatment buys
## HALO       a darker halo under the upper cable — the incumbent, shipped at goal 8
## KNOCKOUT   the lower cable erased for a short span, the upper drawn over the gap
## BUMP       the upper cable lifted into a local arc
## [/codeblock]
##
##   godot --path editor-godot --script crossing_sheet.gd
##
## with CROSSING_SHEET_OUT naming a directory. Not headless: it captures pixels.
##
## ## What it measures as well as shows
##
## The eye decides which construction wins. Two things it should not be asked to estimate
## are measured instead, by diffing each frame against the untreated one:
##
##   how many pixels the treatment touches, over the whole graph
##   how much ink it adds or removes, as a signed luminance total
##
## A treatment that says "these cross and do not join" with the least new ink is the one
## the brief is asking for, and "least" is a number.
