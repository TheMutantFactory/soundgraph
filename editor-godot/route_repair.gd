## Routing goal 3C: when a cable had to move, did it have to move that much?
##
##   godot --headless --path editor-godot --script route_repair.gd
##
## Goal 3 settled *who* may affect a cable — an obstacle that participated in its routing
## decision, and nobody else, which took the unconsulted reroutes from thirteen and eight to
## zero. It left a different question open, and the 34.9x specimen on the dense fixture is
## the whole of it:
##
## > **When an obstacle that was allowed to affect a cable does affect it, did the edit
## > actually require throwing away that much of the existing route?**
##
## No algorithm changes here. This classifies the *old* route against the *new* obstacle
## state, because the three possible answers point at three different repairs and choosing
## between them without the evidence is how a router acquires a mechanism it did not need:
##
##   still legal        the old corridor stayed valid. The router simply preferred another
##                      one — a ranking problem, and continuity preference would fix it.
##   locally repairable the old route broke, but only near the obstacle that moved. The rest
##                      of it is still good — a local segment repair would fix it.
##   corridor-invalid   keeping the old corridor is genuinely impossible. The magnitude may
##                      be unavoidable, and the question becomes candidate richness.
##
## Route memory is deliberately not on that list. "Prefer where this cable used to be"
## introduces session-history semantics — does opening a document produce the routes the
## session that saved it had? — before anything has established that the previous path
## deserved preserving. Two of the three answers above need no memory at all.
