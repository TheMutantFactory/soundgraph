## Derives the post-layout-pass fixtures the routing baseline is measured on.
##
## The state that matters for routing is the one where **every placement operation this
## programme is willing to make has already been asked and has answered**. For babble that
## is: the legalizer correctly does nothing, flow tidy finds one node, and route tidy takes
## it from nine crossings to seven and then declines. What is left is what placement cannot
## reach.
##
##   godot --headless --path editor-godot --script tidy_fixtures.gd
##
## Derived rather than edited in place. `babble.json` is a shipped example and
## `dense-graph-legalized.json` is a witness with its own provenance; overwriting either
## would destroy the evidence they carry. These are new files that say where they came from.
